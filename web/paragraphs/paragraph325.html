entrance, and as perpetually being driven back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Only he did not know it
for an entrance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not know anything about entrances--passages
whereby one goes from one place to another place. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not know any
other place, much less of a way to get there. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">So to him the entrance of
the cave was a wall--a wall of light. </span><span style="color:brown">As the sun was to the outside
dweller, this wall was to him the sun of his world. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It attracted him as
a candle attracts a moth. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was always striving to attain it. </span><span style="color:brown">The life
that was so swiftly expanding within him, urged him continually toward
the wall of light. </span><span style="color:brown">The life that was within him knew that it was the one
way out, the way he was predestined to tread. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he himself did not
know anything about it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not know there was any outside at all. </span></p></div>
