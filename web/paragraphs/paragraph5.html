the sled toiled a second man. </span><span style="color:brown">On the sled, in the box, lay a third man
whose toil was over,--a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down
until he would never move nor struggle again. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It is not the way of the
Wild to like movement. </span><span style="color:brown">Life is an offence to it, for life is movement;
and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. </span><span style="color:brown">It freezes the water to
prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till
they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly
of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man--man who is the
most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all
movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement. </span></p></div>
