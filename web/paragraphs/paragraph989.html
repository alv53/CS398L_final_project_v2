and he had learned it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then the master took him into the chicken-yards. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang's natural impulse, when he saw the live food fluttering about
him and under his very nose, was to spring upon it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He obeyed the
impulse, but was checked by the master's voice. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They continued in the
yards for half an hour. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Time and again the impulse surged over White
Fang, and each time, as he yielded to it, he was checked by the master's
voice. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus it was he learned the law, and ere he left the domain of the
chickens, he had learned to ignore their existence. </span></p></div>
