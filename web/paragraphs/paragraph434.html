side. </span><span style="color:brown">His nose and tongue still hurt, but he was perplexed by a greater
trouble. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was homesick. </span><span style="color:brown">He felt a vacancy in him, a need for the hush
and quietude of the stream and the cave in the cliff. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Life had become
too populous. </span><span style="color:brown">There were so many of the man-animals, men, women, and
children, all making noises and irritations. </span><span style="color:brown">And there were the dogs,
ever squabbling and bickering, bursting into uproars and creating
confusions. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The restful loneliness of the only life he had known was
gone. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Here the very air was palpitant with life. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It hummed and buzzed
unceasingly. </span><span style="color:brown">Continually changing its intensity and abruptly variant in
pitch, it impinged on his nerves and senses, made him nervous and
restless and worried him with a perpetual imminence of happening. </span></p></div>
