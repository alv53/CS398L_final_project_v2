be expected. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was a carnivorous animal. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He came of a breed of meat-
killers and meat-eaters. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His father and mother lived wholly upon meat. </span><span style="color:brown">The milk he had sucked with his first flickering life, was milk
transformed directly from meat, and now, at a month old, when his eyes
