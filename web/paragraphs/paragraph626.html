still lived a public life, in a cage, surrounded by curious men. </span><span style="color:brown">He was
exhibited as "the Fighting Wolf," and men paid fifty cents in gold dust
to see him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was given no rest. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Did he lie down to sleep, he was
stirred up by a sharp stick--so that the audience might get its money's
worth. </span><span style="color:brown">In order to make the exhibition interesting, he was kept in a
rage most of the time. </span><span style="color:brown">But worse than all this, was the atmosphere in
which he lived. </span><span style="color:brown">He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts, and
this was borne in to him through the bars of the cage. </span><span style="color:brown">Every word, every
cautious action, on the part of the men, impressed upon him his own
terrible ferocity. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was so much added fuel to the flame of his
fierceness. </span><span style="color:brown">There could be but one result, and that was that his
ferocity fed upon itself and increased. </span><span style="color:brown">It was another instance of the
plasticity of his clay, of his capacity for being moulded by the pressure
of environment. </span></p></div>
