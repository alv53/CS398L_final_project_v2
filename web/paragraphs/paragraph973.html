Vista was a far vaster affair than the tepee of Grey Beaver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were
many persons to be considered. </span><span style="color:brown">There was Judge Scott, and there was his
wife. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were the master's two sisters, Beth and Mary. </span><span style="color:brown">There was his
wife, Alice, and then there were his children, Weedon and Maud, toddlers
of four and six. </span><span style="color:brown">There was no way for anybody to tell him about all
these people, and of blood-ties and relationship he knew nothing whatever
and never would be capable of knowing. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet he quickly worked it out that
all of them belonged to the master. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, by observation, whenever
opportunity offered, by study of action, speech, and the very intonations
of the voice, he slowly learned the intimacy and the degree of favour
they enjoyed with the master. </span><span style="color:brown">And by this ascertained standard, White
Fang treated them accordingly. </span><span style="color:brown">What was of value to the master he
valued; what was dear to the master was to be cherished by White Fang and
guarded carefully. </span></p></div>
