animals lived in the Wild, and were, when not too formidable, lawful
spoil for any dog. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All his days White Fang had foraged among the live
things for food. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It did not enter his head that in the Southland it was
otherwise. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But this he was to learn early in his residence in Santa
Clara Valley. </span><span style="color:brown">Sauntering around the corner of the house in the early
morning, he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chicken-yard. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang's natural impulse was to eat it. </span><span style="color:brown">A couple of bounds, a flash
of teeth and a frightened squawk, and he had scooped in the adventurous
fowl. </span><span style="color:brown">It was farm-bred and fat and tender; and White Fang licked his
chops and decided that such fare was good. </span></p></div>
