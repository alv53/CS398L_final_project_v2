weasel leaping swiftly away from him. </span><span style="color:brown">It was a small live thing, and he

live thing, only several inches long, a young weasel, that, like himself,
had disobediently gone out adventuring. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It tried to retreat before him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He turned it over with his paw. </span><span style="color:brown">It made a queer, grating noise. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The
