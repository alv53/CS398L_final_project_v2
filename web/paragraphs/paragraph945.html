carriage entered the grounds, when he was set upon by a sheep-dog, bright-
eyed, sharp-muzzled, righteously indignant and angry. </span><span style="color:brown">It was between him
and the master, cutting him off. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang snarled no warning, but his
hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This rush was never
completed. </span><span style="color:brown">He halted with awkward abruptness, with stiff fore-legs
bracing himself against his momentum, almost sitting down on his
haunches, so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in
the act of attacking. </span><span style="color:brown">It was a female, and the law of his kind thrust a
barrier between. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">For him to attack her would require nothing less than a
violation of his instinct. </span></p></div>
