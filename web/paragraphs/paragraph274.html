halted. </span><span style="color:brown">His muzzle went up, his tail stiffened, and his nostrils dilated
as he scented the air. </span><span style="color:brown">One foot also he held up, after the manner of a
dog. </span><span style="color:brown">He was not satisfied, and he continued to smell the air, striving
to understand the message borne upon it to him. </span><span style="color:brown">One careless sniff had
satisfied his mate, and she trotted on to reassure him. </span><span style="color:brown">Though he
followed her, he was still dubious, and he could not forbear an
occasional halt in order more carefully to study the warning. </span></p></div>
