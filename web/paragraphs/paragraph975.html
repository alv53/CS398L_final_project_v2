master's children with an ill but honest grace, and endured their fooling
as one would endure a painful operation. </span><span style="color:brown">When he could no longer endure,
he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them. </span><span style="color:brown">But after a time,
he grew even to like the children. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Still he was not demonstrative. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
would not go up to them. </span><span style="color:brown">On the other hand, instead of walking away at
sight of them, he waited for them to come to him. </span><span style="color:brown">And still later, it
was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them
approaching, and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious
regret when they left him for other amusements. </span></p></div>
