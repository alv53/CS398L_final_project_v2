lower-lying country before their quest was rewarded. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then they came upon
moose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was a big bull they first found. </span><span style="color:brown">Here was meat and life, and
it was guarded by no mysterious fires nor flying missiles of flame. </span><span style="color:brown">Splay
hoofs and palmated antlers they knew, and they flung their customary
patience and caution to the wind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was a brief fight and fierce. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The
big bull was beset on every side. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He ripped them open or split their
skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He crushed them
and broke them on his large horns. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He stamped them into the snow under
him in the wallowing struggle. </span><span style="color:brown">But he was foredoomed, and he went down
with the she-wolf tearing savagely at his throat, and with other teeth
fixed everywhere upon him, devouring him alive, before ever his last
struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought. </span></p></div>
