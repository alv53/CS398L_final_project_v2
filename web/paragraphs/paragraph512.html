savage god. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang was glad to acknowledge his lordship, but it was
a lordship based upon superior intelligence and brute strength. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There
was something in the fibre of White Fang's being that made his lordship a
thing to be desired, else he would not have come back from the Wild when
he did to tender his allegiance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were deeps in his nature which
had never been sounded. </span><span style="color:brown">A kind word, a caressing touch of the hand, on
the part of Grey Beaver, might have sounded these deeps; but Grey Beaver
did not caress, nor speak kind words. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was not his way. </span><span style="color:brown">His primacy
was savage, and savagely he ruled, administering justice with a club,
punishing transgression with the pain of a blow, and rewarding merit, not
by kindness, but by withholding a blow. </span></p></div>
