could not last for ever. </span><span style="color:brown">One or the other must give over, and that one
was White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Fear surged through him again. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">For the first time he
was being really man-handled. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The occasional blows of sticks and stones
he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
broke down and began to cry and yelp. </span><span style="color:brown">For a time each blow brought a

voiced in unbroken succession, unconnected with the rhythm of the
punishment. </span></p></div>
