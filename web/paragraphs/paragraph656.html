his brain and mastering the small bit of sanity that he possessed at
best. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">When he saw White Fang's eyes beginning to glaze, he knew beyond
doubt that the fight was lost. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he broke loose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He sprang upon
White Fang and began savagely to kick him. </span><span style="color:brown">There were hisses from the
crowd and cries of protest, but that was all. </span><span style="color:brown">While this went on, and
Beauty Smith continued to kick White Fang, there was a commotion in the
crowd. </span><span style="color:brown">The tall young newcomer was forcing his way through, shouldering
men right and left without ceremony or gentleness. </span><span style="color:brown">When he broke through
into the ring, Beauty Smith was just in the act of delivering another
kick. </span><span style="color:brown">All his weight was on one foot, and he was in a state of unstable
equilibrium. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At that moment the newcomer's fist landed a smashing blow
full in his face. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Beauty Smith's remaining leg left the ground, and his
whole body seemed to lift into the air as he turned over backward and
struck the snow. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The newcomer turned upon the crowd. </span></p></div>
