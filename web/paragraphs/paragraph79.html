turned their backs on the cheery fire and launched out into the darkness. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At once began to rise the cries that were fiercely sad--cries that called
through the darkness and cold to one another and answered back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Conversation ceased. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Daylight came at nine o'clock. </span><span style="color:brown">At midday the sky
to the south warmed to rose-colour, and marked where the bulge of the
earth intervened between the meridian sun and the northern world. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But

lasted until three o'clock, when it, too, faded, and the pall of the
