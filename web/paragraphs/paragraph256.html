sharp-toothed object of his desire, he shouldered against a young three-
year-old that ran on his blind right side. </span><span style="color:brown">This young wolf had attained
his full size; and, considering the weak and famished condition of the
pack, he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit. </span><span style="color:brown">Nevertheless,
he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his one-eyed elder. </span><span style="color:brown">When
he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf (which was seldom), a snarl
and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again. </span><span style="color:brown">Sometimes,
however, he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the
old leader and the she-wolf. </span><span style="color:brown">This was doubly resented, even triply
resented. </span><span style="color:brown">When she snarled her displeasure, the old leader would whirl
on the three-year-old. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Sometimes she whirled with him. </span><span style="color:brown">And sometimes
the young leader on the left whirled, too. </span></p></div>
