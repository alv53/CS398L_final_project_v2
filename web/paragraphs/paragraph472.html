development he never knew a moment's security. </span><span style="color:brown">The tooth of every dog
was against him, the hand of every man. </span><span style="color:brown">He was greeted with snarls by
his kind, with curses and stones by his gods. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He lived tensely. </span><span style="color:brown">He was
always keyed up, alert for attack, wary of being attacked, with an eye
for sudden and unexpected missiles, prepared to act precipitately and
coolly, to leap in with a flash of teeth, or to leap away with a menacing
snarl. </span></p></div>
