there in the snow, screened from his sight by trees and thickets, Henry
knew that the wolf-pack, One Ear, and Bill were coming together. </span><span style="color:brown">All too
quickly, far more quickly than he had expected, it happened. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He heard a
shot, then two shots, in rapid succession, and he knew that Bill's
ammunition was gone. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he heard a great outcry of snarls and yelps. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He recognised One Ear's yell of pain and terror, and he heard a wolf-cry
that bespoke a stricken animal. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And that was all. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The snarls ceased. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The yelping died away. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Silence settled down again over the lonely land. </span></p></div>
