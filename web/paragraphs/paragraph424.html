of poles caught his eye; yet this in itself was not so remarkable, being
done by the same creatures that flung sticks and stones to great
distances. </span><span style="color:brown">But when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being
covered with cloth and skins, White Fang was astounded. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the
