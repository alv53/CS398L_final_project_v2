no such instinct. </span><span style="color:brown">On the other hand, being a sheep-dog, her instinctive
fear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen. </span><span style="color:brown">White
Fang was to her a wolf, the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her
flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim
ancestor of hers. </span><span style="color:brown">And so, as he abandoned his rush at her and braced
himself to avoid the contact, she sprang upon him. </span><span style="color:brown">He snarled
involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder, but beyond this made
no offer to hurt her. </span><span style="color:brown">He backed away, stiff-legged with
self-consciousness, and tried to go around her. </span><span style="color:brown">He dodged this way and
that, and curved and turned, but to no purpose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">She remained always
between him and the way he wanted to go. </span></p></div>
