final word. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could not go beyond it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The one thing of which he had

himself into a position of hopeless helplessness. </span><span style="color:brown">It was an expression
of perfect confidence, of absolute self-surrender, as though he said: "I
put myself into thy hands. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Work thou thy will with me. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">" </span></p></div>
