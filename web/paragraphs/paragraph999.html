jackrabbit and run it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The master himself was looking on and did not
interfere. </span><span style="color:brown">Nay, he encouraged White Fang to join in the chase. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And thus
he learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the end he worked
