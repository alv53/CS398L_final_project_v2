Fang knew who was coming and began to bristle. </span><span style="color:brown">He had been lying down in
an abandon of comfort, but he arose quickly, and, as the man arrived,
slid away in true wolf-fashion to the edge of the camp. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not know
what they said, but he could see the man and Grey Beaver talking
together. </span><span style="color:brown">Once, the man pointed at him, and White Fang snarled back as
though the hand were just descending upon him instead of being, as it
was, fifty feet away. </span><span style="color:brown">The man laughed at this; and White Fang slunk away
to the sheltering woods, his head turned to observe as he glided softly
over the ground. </span></p></div>
