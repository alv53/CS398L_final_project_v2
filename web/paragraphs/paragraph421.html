licked his hurts and meditated upon this, his first taste of pack-cruelty
and his introduction to the pack. </span><span style="color:brown">He had never dreamed that his own kind
consisted of more than One Eye, his mother, and himself. </span><span style="color:brown">They had
constituted a kind apart, and here, abruptly, he had discovered many more
creatures apparently of his own kind. </span><span style="color:brown">And there was a subconscious
resentment that these, his kind, at first sight had pitched upon him and
tried to destroy him. </span><span style="color:brown">In the same way he resented his mother being tied
with a stick, even though it was done by the superior man-animals. </span><span style="color:brown">It
savoured of the trap, of bondage. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet of the trap and of bondage he knew
nothing. </span><span style="color:brown">Freedom to roam and run and lie down at will, had been his
heritage; and here it was being infringed upon. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His mother's movements
were restricted to the length of a stick, and by the length of that same
stick was he restricted, for he had not yet got beyond the need of his
mother's side. </span></p></div>
