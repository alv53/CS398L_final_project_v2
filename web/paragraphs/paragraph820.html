moulded, to become adept at expressing himself in new ways. </span><span style="color:brown">He was too
self-possessed, too strongly poised in his own isolation. </span><span style="color:brown">Too long had
he cultivated reticence, aloofness, and moroseness. </span><span style="color:brown">He had never barked
in his life, and he could not now learn to bark a welcome when his god
approached. </span><span style="color:brown">He was never in the way, never extravagant nor foolish in
the expression of his love. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never ran to meet his god. </span><span style="color:brown">He waited at
a distance; but he always waited, was always there. </span><span style="color:brown">His love partook of
the nature of worship, dumb, inarticulate, a silent adoration. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Only by
the steady regard of his eyes did he express his love, and by the
unceasing following with his eyes of his god's every movement. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, at
times, when his god looked at him and spoke to him, he betrayed an
awkward self-consciousness, caused by the struggle of his love to express
itself and his physical inability to express it. </span></p></div>
