dogs that died. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never knew defeat. </span><span style="color:brown">His early training, when he
fought with Lip-lip and the whole puppy-pack, stood him in good stead. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was the tenacity with which he clung to the earth. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">No dog could
make him lose his footing. </span><span style="color:brown">This was the favourite trick of the wolf
breeds--to rush in upon him, either directly or with an unexpected
swerve, in the hope of striking his shoulder and overthrowing him. </span><span style="color:brown">Mackenzie hounds, Eskimo and Labrador dogs, huskies and Malemutes--all
tried it on him, and all failed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was never known to lose his footing. </span><span style="color:brown">Men told this to one another, and looked each time to see it happen; but
