marvellous gods as now, when he trod the slimy pavement of San Francisco. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings. </span><span style="color:brown">The
streets were crowded with perils--waggons, carts, automobiles; great,
straining horses pulling huge trucks; and monstrous cable and electric
cars hooting and clanging through the midst, screeching their insistent
menace after the manner of the lynxes he had known in the northern woods. </span></p></div>
