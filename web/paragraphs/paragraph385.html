of his body he clogged the action of the leg and thereby saved his mother
much damage. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A change in the battle crushed him under both their bodies
and wrenched loose his hold. </span><span style="color:brown">The next moment the two mothers separated,
and, before they rushed together again, the lynx lashed out at the cub
with a huge fore-paw that ripped his shoulder open to the bone and sent
him hurtling sidewise against the wall. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then was added to the uproar the
cub's shrill yelp of pain and fright. </span><span style="color:brown">But the fight lasted so long that
he had time to cry himself out and to experience a second burst of
courage; and the end of the battle found him again clinging to a hind-leg
and furiously growling between his teeth. </span></p></div>
