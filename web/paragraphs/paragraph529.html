his own team-mates, it was beyond his self-control to stand idly by while
another devoured the meat that belonged to him. </span><span style="color:brown">He struck, after his
custom, without warning. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">With the first slash, Baseek's right ear was
ripped into ribbons. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was astounded at the suddenness of it. </span><span style="color:brown">But more
things, and most grievous ones, were happening with equal suddenness. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He

struggling to his feet the young dog sank teeth twice into his shoulder. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The swiftness of it was bewildering. </span><span style="color:brown">He made a futile rush at White
Fang, clipping the empty air with an outraged snap. </span><span style="color:brown">The next moment his
