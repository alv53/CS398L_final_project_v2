a week he had eaten his fill. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was even gorged from his latest kill. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But in the moment he looked at Lip-lip his hair rose on end all along his
back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was an involuntary bristling on his part, the physical state
that in the past had always accompanied the mental state produced in him
by Lip-lip's bullying and persecution. </span><span style="color:brown">As in the past he had bristled
and snarled at sight of Lip-lip, so now, and automatically, he bristled
and snarled. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not waste any time. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The thing was done thoroughly
and with despatch. </span><span style="color:brown">Lip-lip essayed to back away, but White Fang struck
him hard, shoulder to shoulder. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Lip-lip was overthrown and rolled upon
his back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang's teeth drove into the scrawny throat. </span><span style="color:brown">There was a
death-struggle, during which White Fang walked around, stiff-legged and
observant. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he resumed his course and trotted on along the base of
the bluff. </span></p></div>
