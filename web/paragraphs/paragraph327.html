thinking customary of men. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His brain worked in dim ways. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet his
conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men. </span><span style="color:brown">He had
a method of accepting things, without questioning the why and wherefore. </span><span style="color:brown">In reality, this was the act of classification. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was never disturbed
over why a thing happened. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">How it happened was sufficient for him. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus,
when he had bumped his nose on the back-wall a few times, he accepted
that he would not disappear into walls. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the same way he accepted that
his father could disappear into walls. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he was not in the least
disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference between his
father and himself. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Logic and physics were no part of his mental make-
up. </span></p></div>
