sleeping against his mother's side. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was aroused by her snarling. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Never had he heard her snarl so terribly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Possibly in her whole life it
was the most terrible snarl she ever gave. </span><span style="color:brown">There was reason for it, and
