ptarmigan dragged him out of the bush. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">When she turned and tried to drag
him back into the bush's shelter, he pulled her away from it and on into
the open. </span><span style="color:brown">And all the time she was making outcry and striking with her
free wing, while feathers were flying like a snow-fall. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The pitch to
which he was aroused was tremendous. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All the fighting blood of his breed
was up in him and surging through him. </span><span style="color:brown">This was living, though he did
not know it. </span><span style="color:brown">He was realising his own meaning in the world; he was doing
that for which he was made--killing meat and battling to kill it. </span><span style="color:brown">He was

achieves its summit when it does to the uttermost that which it was
equipped to do. </span></p></div>
