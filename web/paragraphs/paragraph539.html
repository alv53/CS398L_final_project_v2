Indians. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the summer the fish failed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the winter the cariboo
forsook their accustomed track. </span><span style="color:brown">Moose were scarce, the rabbits almost
disappeared, hunting and preying animals perished. </span><span style="color:brown">Denied their usual
food-supply, weakened by hunger, they fell upon and devoured one another. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Only the strong survived. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang's gods were always hunting animals. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The old and the weak of them died of hunger. </span><span style="color:brown">There was wailing in the
village, where the women and children went without in order that what
little they had might go into the bellies of the lean and hollow-eyed
hunters who trod the forest in the vain pursuit of meat. </span></p></div>
