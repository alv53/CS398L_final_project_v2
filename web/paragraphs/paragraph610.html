around his neck, and passed the end of the thong into Beauty Smith's
keeping, White Fang knew that it was his god's will for him to go with
Beauty Smith. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And when Beauty Smith left him tied outside the fort, he
knew that it was Beauty Smith's will that he should remain there. </span><span style="color:brown">Therefore, he had disobeyed the will of both the gods, and earned the
consequent punishment. </span><span style="color:brown">He had seen dogs change owners in the past, and
he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten. </span><span style="color:brown">He was wise, and
yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than wisdom. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">One of
these was fidelity. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not love Grey Beaver, yet, even in the face
of his will and his anger, he was faithful to him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could not help it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This faithfulness was a quality of the clay that composed him. </span><span style="color:brown">It was
the quality that was peculiarly the possession of his kind; the quality
that set apart his species from all other species; the quality that has
enabled the wolf and the wild dog to come in from the open and be the
companions of man. </span></p></div>
