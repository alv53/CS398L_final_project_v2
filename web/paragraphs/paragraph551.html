narrow stretch of open land sloped down to the Mackenzie. </span><span style="color:brown">He had been
over this ground before, when it was bare, but now a village occupied it. </span><span style="color:brown">Still hidden amongst the trees, he paused to study the situation. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Sights
and sounds and scents were familiar to him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the old village
changed to a new place. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But sights and sounds and smells were different
from those he had last had when he fled away from it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was no
whimpering nor wailing. </span><span style="color:brown">Contented sounds saluted his ear, and when he
heard the angry voice of a woman he knew it to be the anger that proceeds
from a full stomach. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And there was a smell in the air of fish. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There
was food. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The famine was gone. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He came out boldly from the forest and
trotted into camp straight to Grey Beaver's tepee. </span><span style="color:brown">Grey Beaver was not
there; but Kloo-kooch welcomed him with glad cries and the whole of a
fresh-caught fish, and he lay down to wait Grey Beaver's coming. </span></p></div>
