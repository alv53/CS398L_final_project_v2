waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Their bristly fur was rimed
with frost. </span><span style="color:brown">Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths,
spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their
bodies and formed into crystals of frost. </span><span style="color:brown">Leather harness was on the
dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along
behind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The sled was without runners. </span><span style="color:brown">It was made of stout birch-bark,
and its full surface rested on the snow. </span><span style="color:brown">The front end of the sled was
turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of
soft snow that surged like a wave before it. </span><span style="color:brown">On the sled, securely
lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. </span><span style="color:brown">There were other things on the
sled--blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent,
occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box. </span></p></div>
