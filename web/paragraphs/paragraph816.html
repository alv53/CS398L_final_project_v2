would, from the moment the petting began till it ended. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But it was a
growl with a new note in it. </span><span style="color:brown">A stranger could not hear this note, and to
such a stranger the growling of White Fang was an exhibition of
primordial savagery, nerve-racking and blood-curdling. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But White Fang's
throat had become harsh-fibred from the making of ferocious sounds
through the many years since his first little rasp of anger in the lair
of his cubhood, and he could not soften the sounds of that throat now to
express the gentleness he felt. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Nevertheless, Weedon Scott's ear and
sympathy were fine enough to catch the new note all but drowned in the
fierceness--the note that was the faintest hint of a croon of content and
that none but he could hear. </span></p></div>
