Mackenzie. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him. </span><span style="color:brown">One sled he drove
himself, drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed. </span><span style="color:brown">A second and
smaller sled was driven by Mit-sah, and to this was harnessed a team of
puppies. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was more of a toy affair than anything else, yet it was the
delight of Mit-sah, who felt that he was beginning to do a man's work in
the world. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, he was learning to drive dogs and to train dogs; while
the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness. </span><span style="color:brown">Furthermore,
the sled was of some service, for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of
outfit and food. </span></p></div>
