bolder, but lack of sleep was telling upon Henry. </span><span style="color:brown">He dozed despite
himself, crouching by the fire, the blankets about his shoulders, the axe
between his knees, and on either side a dog pressing close against him. </span><span style="color:brown">He awoke once and saw in front of him, not a dozen feet away, a big grey
wolf, one of the largest of the pack. </span><span style="color:brown">And even as he looked, the brute
deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog, yawning
full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye, as if, in
truth, he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten. </span></p></div>
