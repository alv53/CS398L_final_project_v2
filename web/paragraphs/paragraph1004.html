hanging around the saloon at the cross-roads, were three dogs that made a
practice of rushing out upon him when he went by. </span><span style="color:brown">Knowing his deadly
method of fighting, the master had never ceased impressing upon White
Fang the law that he must not fight. </span><span style="color:brown">As a result, having learned the
lesson well, White Fang was hard put whenever he passed the cross-roads
saloon. </span><span style="color:brown">After the first rush, each time, his snarl kept the three dogs
at a distance but they trailed along behind, yelping and bickering and
insulting him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This endured for some time. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The men at the saloon even
urged the dogs on to attack White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">One day they openly sicked the
dogs on him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The master stopped the carriage. </span></p></div>
