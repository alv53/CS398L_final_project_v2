mode of expression--remarkable in that he did it but twice in all his
life. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a
spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the
rider's dismounting. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Time and again and many times he ranged the horse
up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became
frightened and backed and plunged away. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It grew more nervous and excited
every moment. </span><span style="color:brown">When it reared, the master put the spurs to it and made it
drop its fore-legs back to earth, whereupon it would begin kicking with
its hind-legs. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang watched the performance with increasing
anxiety until he could contain himself no longer, when he sprang in front
of the horse and barked savagely and warningly. </span></p></div>
