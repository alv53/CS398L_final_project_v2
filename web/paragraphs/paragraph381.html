hunted in deadly earnestness, and found nothing. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet the failure of it
accelerated his development. </span><span style="color:brown">He studied the habits of the squirrel with
greater carefulness, and strove with greater craft to steal upon it and
surprise it. </span><span style="color:brown">He studied the wood-mice and tried to dig them out of their
burrows; and he learned much about the ways of moose-birds and
woodpeckers. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And there came a day when the hawk's shadow did not drive
him crouching into the bushes. </span><span style="color:brown">He had grown stronger and wiser, and more
confident. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, he was desperate. </span><span style="color:brown">So he sat on his haunches,
conspicuously in an open space, and challenged the hawk down out of the

the meat his stomach yearned after so insistently. </span><span style="color:brown">But the hawk refused
to come down and give battle, and the cub crawled away into a thicket and
whimpered his disappointment and hunger. </span></p></div>
