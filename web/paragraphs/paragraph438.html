his altars crumbling; but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in
to crouch at man's feet, this grief has never come. </span><span style="color:brown">Unlike man, whose
gods are of the unseen and the overguessed, vapours and mists of fancy
eluding the garmenture of reality, wandering wraiths of desired goodness
and power, intangible out-croppings of self into the realm of
spirit--unlike man, the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the
fire find their gods in the living flesh, solid to the touch, occupying
earth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and
their existence. </span><span style="color:brown">No effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a
god; no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There
is no getting away from it. </span><span style="color:brown">There it stands, on its two hind-legs, club
in hand, immensely potential, passionate and wrathful and loving, god and
mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it
is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh. </span></p></div>
