touched Grey Beaver's knee, so curious was he, and already forgetful that
this was a terrible man-animal. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Suddenly he saw a strange thing like
mist beginning to arise from the sticks and moss beneath Grey Beaver's
hands. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, amongst the sticks themselves, appeared a live thing,
twisting and turning, of a colour like the colour of the sun in the sky. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang knew nothing about fire. </span><span style="color:brown">It drew him as the light, in the
mouth of the cave had drawn him in his early puppyhood. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He crawled the
several steps toward the flame. </span><span style="color:brown">He heard Grey Beaver chuckle above him,
and he knew the sound was not hostile. </span><span style="color:brown">Then his nose touched the flame,
and at the same instant his little tongue went out to it. </span></p></div>
