and stopped munching the tallow. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang crawled slowly, cringing and
grovelling in the abjectness of his abasement and submission. </span><span style="color:brown">He crawled
straight toward Grey Beaver, every inch of his progress becoming slower
and more painful. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At last he lay at the master's feet, into whose
possession he now surrendered himself, voluntarily, body and soul. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Of
his own choice, he came in to sit by man's fire and to be ruled by him. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang trembled, waiting for the punishment to fall upon him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There
was a movement of the hand above him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He cringed involuntarily under the
expected blow. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It did not fall. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He stole a glance upward. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Grey Beaver
was breaking the lump of tallow in half! </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Grey Beaver was offering him
one piece of the tallow! </span><span style="color:brown">Very gently and somewhat suspiciously, he first
smelled the tallow and then proceeded to eat it. </span><span style="color:brown">Grey Beaver ordered
meat to be brought to him, and guarded him from the other dogs while he
ate. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">After that, grateful and content, White Fang lay at Grey Beaver's
feet, gazing at the fire that warmed him, blinking and dozing, secure in
the knowledge that the morrow would find him, not wandering forlorn
through bleak forest-stretches, but in the camp of the man-animals, with
the gods to whom he had given himself and upon whom he was now dependent. </span></p></div>
