red-written on the snow. </span><span style="color:brown">Forgotten, save once, when old One Eye stopped
for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds. </span><span style="color:brown">Then it was that his lips
half writhed into a snarl, and the hair of his neck and shoulders
involuntarily bristled, while he half crouched for a spring, his claws
spasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing. </span><span style="color:brown">But it
was all forgotten the next moment, as he sprang after the she-wolf, who
was coyly leading him a chase through the woods. </span></p></div>
