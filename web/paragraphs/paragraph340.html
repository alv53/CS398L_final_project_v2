was he to know that this thing that sniffed was a thing at which to
bristle? </span><span style="color:brown">It was not born of any knowledge of his, yet it was the visible
expression of the fear that was in him, and for which, in his own life,
there was no accounting. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But fear was accompanied by another
instinct--that of concealment. </span><span style="color:brown">The cub was in a frenzy of terror, yet he
lay without movement or sound, frozen, petrified into immobility, to all
appearances dead. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His mother, coming home, growled as she smelt the
wolverine's track, and bounded into the cave and licked and nozzled him
with undue vehemence of affection. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And the cub felt that somehow he had
escaped a great hurt. </span></p></div>
