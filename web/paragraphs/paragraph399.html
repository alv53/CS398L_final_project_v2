dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to
primacy over the other animals of the Wild. </span><span style="color:brown">Not alone out of his own
eyes, but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking
upon man--out of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless
winter camp-fires, that had peered from safe distances and from the
hearts of thickets at the strange, two-legged animal that was lord over
living things. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The spell of the cub's heritage was upon him, the fear
and the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated
experience of the generations. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The heritage was too compelling for a
wolf that was only a cub. </span><span style="color:brown">Had he been full-grown, he would have run
away. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">As it was, he cowered down in a paralysis of fear, already half
proffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first time
a wolf came in to sit by man's fire and be made warm. </span></p></div>
