steady clearness. </span><span style="color:brown">And while his eyes were still closed, he had felt,
tasted, and smelled. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He knew his two brothers and his two sisters very
well. </span><span style="color:brown">He had begun to romp with them in a feeble, awkward way, and even
to squabble, his little throat vibrating with a queer rasping noise (the
forerunner of the growl), as he worked himself into a passion. </span><span style="color:brown">And long
before his eyes had opened he had learned by touch, taste, and smell to
know his mother--a fount of warmth and liquid food and tenderness. </span><span style="color:brown">She
possessed a gentle, caressing tongue that soothed him when it passed over
his soft little body, and that impelled him to snuggle close against her
and to doze off to sleep. </span></p></div>
