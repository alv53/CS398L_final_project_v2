made. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Possibly he accepted it as one of the restrictions of life. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">For
he had already learned that there were such restrictions. </span><span style="color:brown">Hunger he had
known; and when he could not appease his hunger he had felt restriction. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The hard obstruction of the cave-wall, the sharp nudge of his mother's
