he thought a long way off, would the next instant hit him on the nose or
rake along his ribs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were inequalities of surface. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Sometimes he
overstepped and stubbed his nose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Quite as often he understepped and
stubbed his feet. </span><span style="color:brown">Then there were the pebbles and stones that turned
under him when he trod upon them; and from them he came to know that the
things not alive were not all in the same state of stable equilibrium as
was his cave--also, that small things not alive were more liable than
large things to fall down or turn over. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But with every mishap he was
learning. </span><span style="color:brown">The longer he walked, the better he walked. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was adjusting
