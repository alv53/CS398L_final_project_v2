Leghorn hens, laid out in a row by the groom, greeted his eyes. </span><span style="color:brown">He
whistled to himself, softly, first with surprise, and then, at the end,
with admiration. </span><span style="color:brown">His eyes were likewise greeted by White Fang, but about
the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt. </span><span style="color:brown">He carried himself
with pride, as though, forsooth, he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and
meritorious. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was about him no consciousness of sin. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The master's
lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he talked harshly
to the unwitting culprit, and in his voice there was nothing but godlike
wrath. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Also, he held White Fang's nose down to the slain hens, and at
the same time cuffed him soundly. </span></p></div>
