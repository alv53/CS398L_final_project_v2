rush of it and the beat of angry wings. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He hid his head between his paws
and yelped. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The blows increased. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The mother ptarmigan was in a fury. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he became angry. </span><span style="color:brown">He rose up, snarling, striking out with his paws. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He sank his tiny teeth into one of the wings and pulled and tugged

in ways new to him and greater to him than any he had known before. </span></p></div>
