that a thieving god was usually a cowardly god and prone to run away at
the sounding of the alarm. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, he learned that but brief time elapsed
between his sounding of the alarm and Grey Beaver coming to his aid. </span><span style="color:brown">He
came to know that it was not fear of him that drove the thief away, but
fear of Grey Beaver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang did not give the alarm by barking. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
never barked. </span><span style="color:brown">His method was to drive straight at the intruder, and to
sink his teeth in if he could. </span><span style="color:brown">Because he was morose and solitary,
having nothing to do with the other dogs, he was unusually fitted to
guard his master's property; and in this he was encouraged and trained by
Grey Beaver. </span><span style="color:brown">One result of this was to make White Fang more ferocious
and indomitable, and more solitary. </span></p></div>
