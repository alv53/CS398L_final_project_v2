dwindled to a growl that ebbed down in his throat and ceased. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then the
god spoke, and at the first sound of his voice, the hair rose on White
Fang's neck and the growl rushed up in his throat. </span><span style="color:brown">But the god made no
hostile movement, and went on calmly talking. </span><span style="color:brown">For a time White Fang
growled in unison with him, a correspondence of rhythm being established
between growl and voice. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the god talked on interminably. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He talked
to White Fang as White Fang had never been talked to before. </span><span style="color:brown">He talked
softly and soothingly, with a gentleness that somehow, somewhere, touched
White Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">In spite of himself and all the pricking warnings of his
instinct, White Fang began to have confidence in this god. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had a
feeling of security that was belied by all his experience with men. </span></p></div>
