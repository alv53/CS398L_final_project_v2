dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Thus it was with White
Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Three Eagles was
going away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake. </span><span style="color:brown">A strip
of scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche, went to pay
the debt. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles' canoe,
and tried to follow her. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward
to the land. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The canoe shoved off. </span><span style="color:brown">He sprang into the water and swam
after it, deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return. </span><span style="color:brown">Even a man-
animal, a god, White Fang ignored, such was the terror he was in of
