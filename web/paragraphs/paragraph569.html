had crossed the great watershed between Mackenzie and the Yukon in the
late winter, and spent the spring in hunting among the western outlying
spurs of the Rockies. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, after the break-up of the ice on the
Porcupine, he had built a canoe and paddled down that stream to where it
effected its junction with the Yukon just under the Arctic circle. </span><span style="color:brown">Here
stood the old Hudson's Bay Company fort; and here were many Indians, much
food, and unprecedented excitement. </span><span style="color:brown">It was the summer of 1898, and
thousands of gold-hunters were going up the Yukon to Dawson and the
Klondike. </span><span style="color:brown">Still hundreds of miles from their goal, nevertheless many of
them had been on the way for a year, and the least any of them had
travelled to get that far was five thousand miles, while some had come
from the other side of the world. </span></p></div>
