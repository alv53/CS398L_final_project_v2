saved the hound's life. </span><span style="color:brown">Before White Fang could spring in and deliver
the fatal stroke, and just as he was in the act of springing in, Collie
arrived. </span><span style="color:brown">She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run, to say nothing of her
having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel, and her arrival was
like that of a tornado--made up of offended dignity, justifiable wrath,
and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild. </span><span style="color:brown">She struck White
