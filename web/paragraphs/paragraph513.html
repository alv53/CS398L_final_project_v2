him. </span><span style="color:brown">Besides, he did not like the hands of the man-animals. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was
suspicious of them. </span><span style="color:brown">It was true that they sometimes gave meat, but more
often they gave hurt. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Hands were things to keep away from. </span><span style="color:brown">They hurled
stones, wielded sticks and clubs and whips, administered slaps and
clouts, and, when they touched him, were cunning to hurt with pinch and
twist and wrench. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In strange villages he had encountered the hands of
the children and learned that they were cruel to hurt. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, he had once
nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">From these
experiences he became suspicious of all children. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could not tolerate
them. </span><span style="color:brown">When they came near with their ominous hands, he got up. </span></p></div>
