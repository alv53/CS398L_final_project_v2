all directions that defied attack. </span><span style="color:brown">In his youth One Eye had once sniffed
too near a similar, apparently inert ball of quills, and had the tail
flick out suddenly in his face. </span><span style="color:brown">One quill he had carried away in his
muzzle, where it had remained for weeks, a rankling flame, until it
finally worked out. </span><span style="color:brown">So he lay down, in a comfortable crouching position,
his nose fully a foot away, and out of the line of the tail. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus he
waited, keeping perfectly quiet. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was no telling. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Something might
happen. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The porcupine might unroll. </span><span style="color:brown">There might be opportunity for a
deft and ripping thrust of paw into the tender, unguarded belly. </span></p></div>
