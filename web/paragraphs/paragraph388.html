the killing of meat and began to play his part in it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And in his own dim
way he learned the law of meat. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were two kinds of life--his own
kind and the other kind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His own kind included his mother and himself. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The other kind included all live things that moved. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the other kind
was divided. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">One portion was what his own kind killed and ate. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This
portion was composed of the non-killers and the small killers. </span><span style="color:brown">The other
portion killed and ate his own kind, or was killed and eaten by his own
kind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And out of this classification arose the law. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The aim of life was
meat. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Life itself was meat. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Life lived on life. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were the eaters
and the eaten. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The law was: EAT OR BE EATEN. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not formulate the
law in clear, set terms and moralise about it. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not even think the
law; he merely lived the law without thinking about it at all. </span></p></div>
