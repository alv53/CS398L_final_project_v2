god's dog, bitten his companion god, and what else was to be expected
than some terrible punishment? </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But in the face of it he was indomitable. </span><span style="color:brown">He bristled and showed his teeth, his eyes vigilant, his whole body wary
and prepared for anything. </span><span style="color:brown">The god had no club, so he suffered him to
approach quite near. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The god's hand had come out and was descending upon
his head. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang shrank together and grew tense as he crouched under
it. </span><span style="color:brown">Here was danger, some treachery or something. </span><span style="color:brown">He knew the hands of
the gods, their proved mastery, their cunning to hurt. </span><span style="color:brown">Besides, there
was his old antipathy to being touched. </span><span style="color:brown">He snarled more menacingly,
crouched still lower, and still the hand descended. </span><span style="color:brown">He did not want to
bite the hand, and he endured the peril of it until his instinct surged
up in him, mastering him with its insatiable yearning for life. </span></p></div>
