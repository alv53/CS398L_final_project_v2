resenting the evil of the hands of the man-animals, he came to modify the
law that he had learned from Grey Beaver: namely, that the unpardonable
crime was to bite one of the gods. </span><span style="color:brown">In this village, after the custom of
all dogs in all villages, White Fang went foraging, for food. </span><span style="color:brown">A boy was
chopping frozen moose-meat with an axe, and the chips were flying in the
snow. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang, sliding by in quest of meat, stopped and began to eat
the chips. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He observed the boy lay down the axe and take up a stout
club. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang sprang clear, just in time to escape the descending
blow. </span><span style="color:brown">The boy pursued him, and he, a stranger in the village, fled
between two tepees to find himself cornered against a high earth bank. </span></p></div>
