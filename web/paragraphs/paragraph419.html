see the man-animals driving back the dogs with clubs and stones,
defending him, saving him from the savage teeth of his kind that somehow
was not his kind. </span><span style="color:brown">And though there was no reason in his brain for a
clear conception of so abstract a thing as justice, nevertheless, in his
own way, he felt the justice of the man-animals, and he knew them for
what they were--makers of law and executors of law. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, he appreciated
the power with which they administered the law. </span><span style="color:brown">Unlike any animals he
had ever encountered, they did not bite nor claw. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They enforced their
live strength with the power of dead things. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Dead things did their

the dogs. </span></p></div>
