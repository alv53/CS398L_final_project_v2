had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and
they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading
light. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A vast silence reigned over the land. </span><span style="color:brown">The land itself was a
desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit
of it was not even that of sadness. </span><span style="color:brown">There was a hint in it of laughter,
but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness--a laughter that was
mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and
partaking of the grimness of infallibility. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the masterful and
incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and
the effort of life. </span><span style="color:brown">It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted
Northland Wild. </span></p></div>
