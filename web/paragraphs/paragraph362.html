before. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The footing looked good. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were no inequalities of surface. </span><span style="color:brown">He stepped boldly out on it; and went down, crying with fear, into the
embrace of the unknown. </span><span style="color:brown">It was cold, and he gasped, breathing quickly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The water rushed into his lungs instead of the air that had always
accompanied his act of breathing. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The suffocation he experienced was
like the pang of death. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">To him it signified death. </span><span style="color:brown">He had no conscious
knowledge of death, but like every animal of the Wild, he possessed the
instinct of death. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">To him it stood as the greatest of hurts. </span><span style="color:brown">It was the

unknown, the one culminating and unthinkable catastrophe that could
happen to him, about which he knew nothing and about which he feared
everything. </span></p></div>
