emitted a low, warning whistle. </span><span style="color:brown">Bill turned and looked, then quietly

into view, on the very trail they had just covered, trotted a furry,
slinking form. </span><span style="color:brown">Its nose was to the trail, and it trotted with a
peculiar, sliding, effortless gait. </span><span style="color:brown">When they halted, it halted,
throwing up its head and regarding them steadily with nostrils that
twitched as it caught and studied the scent of them. </span></p></div>
