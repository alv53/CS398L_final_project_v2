they were his own kind, only somehow different. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But they displayed
little difference from the wolf when they discovered the cub and his
mother. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a rush. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang bristled and snarled and snapped
in the face of the open-mouthed oncoming wave of dogs, and went down and
under them, feeling the sharp slash of teeth in his body, himself biting
and tearing at the legs and bellies above him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a great uproar. </span><span style="color:brown">He could hear the snarl of Kiche as she fought for him; and he could hear
the cries of the man-animals, the sound of clubs striking upon bodies,
and the yelps of pain from the dogs so struck. </span></p></div>
