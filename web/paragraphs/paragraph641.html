puzzled White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Never had he seen such a dog. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It had no hair
protection. </span><span style="color:brown">It was soft, and bled easily. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was no thick mat of fur
to baffle White Fang's teeth as they were often baffled by dogs of his
own breed. </span><span style="color:brown">Each time that his teeth struck they sank easily into the
yielding flesh, while the animal did not seem able to defend itself. </span><span style="color:brown">Another disconcerting thing was that it made no outcry, such as he had
been accustomed to with the other dogs he had fought. </span><span style="color:brown">Beyond a growl or
a grunt, the dog took its punishment silently. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And never did it flag in
