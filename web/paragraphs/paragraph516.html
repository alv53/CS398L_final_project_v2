driven his teeth into the sacred flesh of one of them, and could expect
nothing but a most terrible punishment. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He fled away to Grey Beaver,
behind whose protecting legs he crouched when the bitten boy and the
boy's family came, demanding vengeance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But they went away with
vengeance unsatisfied. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Grey Beaver defended White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">So did Mit-sah
and Kloo-kooch. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang, listening to the wordy war and watching the
angry gestures, knew that his act was justified. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And so it came that he
learned there were gods and gods. </span><span style="color:brown">There were his gods, and there were
other gods, and between them there was a difference. </span><span style="color:brown">Justice or
injustice, it was all the same, he must take all things from the hands of
his own gods. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he was not compelled to take injustice from the other
gods. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was his privilege to resent it with his teeth. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And this also
was a law of the gods. </span></p></div>
