combat--snarlings and bristlings and stiff-legged struttings. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But White
Fang learned to omit these preliminaries. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Delay meant the coming against
him of all the young dogs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He must do his work quickly and get away. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">So
he learnt to give no warning of his intention. </span><span style="color:brown">He rushed in and snapped
and slashed on the instant, without notice, before his foe could prepare
to meet him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Thus he learned how to inflict quick and severe damage. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Also he learned the value of surprise. </span><span style="color:brown">A dog, taken off its guard, its
shoulder slashed open or its ear ripped in ribbons before it knew what
was happening, was a dog half whipped. </span></p></div>
