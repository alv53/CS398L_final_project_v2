compared with the Indians he had known, they were to him another race of
beings, a race of superior gods. </span><span style="color:brown">They impressed him as possessing
superior power, and it is on power that godhead rests. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang did
not reason it out, did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that
the white gods were more powerful. </span><span style="color:brown">It was a feeling, nothing more, and
yet none the less potent. </span><span style="color:brown">As, in his puppyhood, the looming bulks of the
tepees, man-reared, had affected him as manifestations of power, so was
he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Here
was power. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Those white gods were strong. </span><span style="color:brown">They possessed greater mastery
over matter than the gods he had known, most powerful among which was
Grey Beaver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god among these white-
skinned ones. </span></p></div>
