gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut
trees. </span><span style="color:brown">On either side stretched lawns, their broad sweep broken here and
there by great sturdy-limbed oaks. </span><span style="color:brown">In the near distance, in contrast
with the young-green of the tended grass, sunburnt hay-fields showed tan
and gold; while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures. </span><span style="color:brown">From

looked down the deep-porched, many-windowed house. </span></p></div>
