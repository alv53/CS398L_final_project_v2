must find meat. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the afternoon he blundered upon a ptarmigan. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He came
out of a thicket and found himself face to face with the slow-witted
bird. </span><span style="color:brown">It was sitting on a log, not a foot beyond the end of his nose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Each saw the other. </span><span style="color:brown">The bird made a startled rise, but he struck it with
his paw, and smashed it down to earth, then pounced upon it, and caught
it in his teeth as it scuttled across the snow trying to rise in the air
again. </span><span style="color:brown">As his teeth crunched through the tender flesh and fragile bones,
he began naturally to eat. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he remembered, and, turning on the back-
track, started for home, carrying the ptarmigan in his mouth. </span></p></div>
