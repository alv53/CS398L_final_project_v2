to make him in his comportment older than his age. </span><span style="color:brown">Denied the outlet,
through play, of his energies, he recoiled upon himself and developed his
mental processes. </span><span style="color:brown">He became cunning; he had idle time in which to devote
himself to thoughts of trickery. </span><span style="color:brown">Prevented from obtaining his share of
meat and fish when a general feed was given to the camp-dogs, he became a
clever thief. </span><span style="color:brown">He had to forage for himself, and he foraged well, though
he was oft-times a plague to the squaws in consequence. </span><span style="color:brown">He learned to
sneak about camp, to be crafty, to know what was going on everywhere, to
see and to hear everything and to reason accordingly, and successfully to
devise ways and means of avoiding his implacable persecutor. </span></p></div>
