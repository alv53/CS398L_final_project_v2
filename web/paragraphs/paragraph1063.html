very quietly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And very quietly he smelled the air and read the message
it bore of a strange god's presence. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And to his ears came sounds of the
strange god's movements. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang burst into no furious outcry. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It
was not his way. </span><span style="color:brown">The strange god walked softly, but more softly walked
White Fang, for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He followed silently. </span><span style="color:brown">In the Wild he had hunted live meat that was
infinitely timid, and he knew the advantage of surprise. </span></p></div>
