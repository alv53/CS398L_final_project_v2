White Fang's teeth could reach. </span><span style="color:brown">He got hold toward the base where the
neck comes out from the shoulders; but he did not know the chewing method
of fighting, nor were his jaws adapted to it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He spasmodically ripped
and tore with his fangs for a space. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then a change in their position
diverted him. </span><span style="color:brown">The bull-dog had managed to roll him over on his back, and
still hanging on to his throat, was on top of him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Like a cat, White
Fang bowed his hind-quarters in, and, with the feet digging into his
enemy's abdomen above him, he began to claw with long tearing-strokes. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Cherokee might well have been disembowelled had he not quickly pivoted on
his grip and got his body off of White Fang's and at right angles to it. </span></p></div>
