party to a police conspiracy, that the evidence was hatched and perjured,
that Jim Hall was guiltless of the crime charged. </span><span style="color:brown">And Jim Hall, on the
other hand, did not know that Judge Scott was merely ignorant. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Jim Hall
believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the
police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice. </span><span style="color:brown">So it was, when
the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by Judge Scott, that
Jim Hall, hating all things in the society that misused him, rose up and
raged in the court-room until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue-
coated enemies. </span><span style="color:brown">To him, Judge Scott was the keystone in the arch of
injustice, and upon Judge Scott he emptied the vials of his wrath and
hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then Jim Hall went to his
living death . </span><span style="color:#00CD66">. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">and escaped. </span></p></div>
