in the country. </span><span style="color:brown">They called themselves Sour-doughs, and took great pride
in so classifying themselves. </span><span style="color:brown">For other men, new in the land, they felt
nothing but disdain. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The men who came ashore from the steamers were
newcomers. </span><span style="color:brown">They were known as _chechaquos_, and they always wilted at
the application of the name. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They made their bread with baking-powder. </span><span style="color:brown">This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs, who,
forsooth, made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-
powder. </span></p></div>
