and she never failed to bring him his share. </span><span style="color:brown">Further, she was unafraid
of things. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It did not occur to him that this fearlessness was founded
upon experience and knowledge. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Its effect on him was that of an
impression of power. </span><span style="color:brown">His mother represented power; and as he grew older
he felt this power in the sharper admonishment of her paw; while the
reproving nudge of her nose gave place to the slash of her fangs. </span><span style="color:brown">For
this, likewise, he respected his mother. </span><span style="color:brown">She compelled obedience from
him, and the older he grew the shorter grew her temper. </span></p></div>
