while his character was developing along the lines laid down by his
heredity and his environment. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His heredity was a life-stuff that may be
likened to clay. </span><span style="color:brown">It possessed many possibilities, was capable of being
moulded into many different forms. </span><span style="color:brown">Environment served to model the clay,
to give it a particular form. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus, had White Fang never come in to the
fires of man, the Wild would have moulded him into a true wolf. </span><span style="color:brown">But the
gods had given him a different environment, and he was moulded into a dog
that was rather wolfish, but that was a dog and not a wolf. </span></p></div>
