mother than the soft, soothing tongue. </span><span style="color:brown">In his insistent crawling toward
the light, he discovered in her a nose that with a sharp nudge
administered rebuke, and later, a paw, that crushed him down and rolled
him over and over with swift, calculating stroke. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus he learned hurt;
and on top of it he learned to avoid hurt, first, by not incurring the
risk of it; and second, when he had incurred the risk, by dodging and by
retreating. </span><span style="color:brown">These were conscious actions, and were the results of his
first generalisations upon the world. </span><span style="color:brown">Before that he had recoiled
automatically from hurt, as he had crawled automatically toward the
light. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">After that he recoiled from hurt because he _knew_ that it was
hurt. </span></p></div>
