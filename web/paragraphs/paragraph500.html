of varying length prevented the dogs attacking from the rear those that
ran in front of them. </span><span style="color:brown">For a dog to attack another, it would have to turn
upon one at a shorter rope. </span><span style="color:brown">In which case it would find itself face to
face with the dog attacked, and also it would find itself facing the whip
of the driver. </span><span style="color:brown">But the most peculiar virtue of all lay in the fact that
the dog that strove to attack one in front of him must pull the sled
faster, and that the faster the sled travelled, the faster could the dog
attacked run away. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus, the dog behind could never catch up with the
one in front. </span><span style="color:brown">The faster he ran, the faster ran the one he was after,
and the faster ran all the dogs. </span><span style="color:brown">Incidentally, the sled went faster, and
thus, by cunning indirection, did man increase his mastery over the
beasts. </span></p></div>
