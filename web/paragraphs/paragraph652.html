waxed jubilant and offered ridiculous odds. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang's backers were
correspondingly depressed, and refused bets of ten to one and twenty to
one, though one man was rash enough to close a wager of fifty to one. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This man was Beauty Smith. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He took a step into the ring and pointed his
finger at White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he began to laugh derisively and scornfully. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This produced the desired effect. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang went wild with rage. </span><span style="color:brown">He
called up his reserves of strength, and gained his feet. </span><span style="color:brown">As he struggled
around the ring, the fifty pounds of his foe ever dragging on his throat,
his anger passed on into panic. </span><span style="color:brown">The basic life of him dominated him
again, and his intelligence fled before the will of his flesh to live. </span><span style="color:brown">Round and round and back again, stumbling and falling and rising, even
uprearing at times on his hind-legs and lifting his foe clear of the
earth, he struggled vainly to shake off the clinging death. </span></p></div>
