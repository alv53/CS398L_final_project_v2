methods and remarkable efficiency made the pack pay for its persecution
of him. </span><span style="color:brown">Not permitted himself to run with the pack, the curious state of
affairs obtained that no member of the pack could run outside the pack. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang would not permit it. </span><span style="color:brown">What of his bushwhacking and waylaying
tactics, the young dogs were afraid to run by themselves. </span><span style="color:brown">With the
exception of Lip-lip, they were compelled to hunch together for mutual
protection against the terrible enemy they had made. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A puppy alone by

its shrill pain and terror as it fled back from the wolf-cub that had
waylaid it. </span></p></div>
