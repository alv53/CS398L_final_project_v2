was running in the river, Beauty Smith took passage for himself and White
Fang on a steamboat bound up the Yukon to Dawson. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang had now
achieved a reputation in the land. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">As "the Fighting Wolf" he was known
far and wide, and the cage in which he was kept on the steam-boat's deck
was usually surrounded by curious men. </span><span style="color:brown">He raged and snarled at them, or
lay quietly and studied them with cold hatred. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Why should he not hate
them? </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never asked himself the question. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He knew only hate and lost
himself in the passion of it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Life had become a hell to him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had not
been made for the close confinement wild beasts endure at the hands of
men. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And yet it was in precisely this way that he was treated. </span><span style="color:brown">Men
stared at him, poked sticks between the bars to make him snarl, and then
laughed at him. </span></p></div>
