she caressed the cub and licked his wounded shoulder; but the blood she
had lost had taken with it her strength, and for all of a day and a night
she lay by her dead foe's side, without movement, scarcely breathing. </span><span style="color:brown">For
a week she never left the cave, except for water, and then her movements
were slow and painful. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At the end of that time the lynx was devoured,
while the she-wolf's wounds had healed sufficiently to permit her to take
the meat-trail again. </span></p></div>
