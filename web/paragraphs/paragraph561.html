previous night was erased, and that night would have to be learned over
again, to be as immediately forgotten. </span><span style="color:brown">Besides, there was a greater
consistence in their dislike of him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They sensed between themselves and
him a difference of kind--cause sufficient in itself for hostility. </span><span style="color:brown">Like
