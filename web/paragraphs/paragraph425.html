women and children passing in and out of them without harm, and he saw
the dogs trying often to get into them, and being driven away with sharp
words and flying stones. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">After a time, he left Kiche's side and crawled
cautiously toward the wall of the nearest tepee. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the curiosity of
growth that urged him on--the necessity of learning and living and doing
that brings experience. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The last few inches to the wall of the tepee
were crawled with painful slowness and precaution. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The day's events had
prepared him for the unknown to manifest itself in most stupendous and
unthinkable ways. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At last his nose touched the canvas. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He waited. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Nothing happened. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he smelled the strange fabric, saturated with the
man-smell. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He closed on the canvas with his teeth and gave a gentle tug. </span><span style="color:brown">Nothing happened, though the adjacent portions of the tepee moved. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
tugged harder. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a greater movement. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was delightful. </span><span style="color:brown">He
tugged still harder, and repeatedly, until the whole tepee was in motion. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then the sharp cry of a squaw inside sent him scampering back to Kiche. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But after that he was afraid no more of the looming bulks of the tepees. </span></p></div>
