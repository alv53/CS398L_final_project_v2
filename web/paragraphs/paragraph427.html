dangerous; so White Fang prepared to meet him in a friendly spirit. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But
when the stranger's walk became stiff-legged and his lips lifted clear of
his teeth, White Fang stiffened too, and answered with lifted lips. </span><span style="color:brown">They
half circled about each other, tentatively, snarling and bristling. </span><span style="color:brown">This
lasted several minutes, and White Fang was beginning to enjoy it, as a
sort of game. </span><span style="color:brown">But suddenly, with remarkable swiftness, Lip-lip leaped
in, delivering a slashing snap, and leaped away again. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The snap had
taken effect on the shoulder that had been hurt by the lynx and that was
still sore deep down near the bone. </span><span style="color:brown">The surprise and hurt of it brought
a yelp out of White Fang; but the next moment, in a rush of anger, he was
upon Lip-lip and snapping viciously. </span></p></div>
