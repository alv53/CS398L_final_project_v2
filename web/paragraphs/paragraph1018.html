the throwing of a crooning note into his love-growl, he had no way of
expressing his love. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet it was given him to discover a third way. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
had always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods. </span><span style="color:brown">Laughter had
affected him with madness, made him frantic with rage. </span><span style="color:brown">But he did not
have it in him to be angry with the love-master, and when that god
elected to laugh at him in a good-natured, bantering way, he was
nonplussed. </span><span style="color:brown">He could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as
it strove to rise up in him, but it strove against love. </span><span style="color:brown">He could not be
angry; yet he had to do something. </span><span style="color:brown">At first he was dignified, and the
master laughed the harder. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he tried to be more dignified, and the
master laughed harder than before. </span><span style="color:brown">In the end, the master laughed him
out of his dignity. </span><span style="color:brown">His jaws slightly parted, his lips lifted a little,
and a quizzical expression that was more love than humour came into his
eyes. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had learned to laugh. </span></p></div>
