of agony from the porcupine, the big cat's squall of sudden hurt and
astonishment. </span><span style="color:brown">One Eye half arose in his excitement, his ears up, his
tail straight out and quivering behind him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The lynx's bad temper got
the best of her. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her. </span><span style="color:brown">But
the porcupine, squealing and grunting, with disrupted anatomy trying
feebly to roll up into its ball-protection, flicked out its tail again,
and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment. </span><span style="color:brown">Then she fell
to backing away and sneezing, her nose bristling with quills like a
monstrous pin-cushion. </span><span style="color:brown">She brushed her nose with her paws, trying to
dislodge the fiery darts, thrust it into the snow, and rubbed it against
twigs and branches, and all the time leaping about, ahead, sidewise, up
and down, in a frenzy of pain and fright. </span></p></div>
