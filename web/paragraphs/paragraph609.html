victim, and his eyes flamed dully, as he swung the whip or club and
listened to White Fang's cries of pain and to his helpless bellows and
snarls. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">For Beauty Smith was cruel in the way that cowards are cruel. </span><span style="color:brown">Cringing and snivelling himself before the blows or angry speech of a
man, he revenged himself, in turn, upon creatures weaker than he. </span><span style="color:brown">All
life likes power, and Beauty Smith was no exception. </span><span style="color:brown">Denied the
expression of power amongst his own kind, he fell back upon the lesser
creatures and there vindicated the life that was in him. </span><span style="color:brown">But Beauty
Smith had not created himself, and no blame was to be attached to him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
had come into the world with a twisted body and a brute intelligence. </span><span style="color:brown">This had constituted the clay of him, and it had not been kindly moulded
by the world. </span></p></div>
