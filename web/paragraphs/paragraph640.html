Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">The display on both sides, the quickness of the one and the
steadiness of the other, had excited the partisan spirit of the crowd,
and the men were making new bets and increasing original bets. </span><span style="color:brown">Again,
and yet again, White Fang sprang in, slashed, and got away untouched, and
still his strange foe followed after him, without too great haste, not
slowly, but deliberately and determinedly, in a businesslike sort of way. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was purpose in his method--something for him to do that he was
intent upon doing and from which nothing could distract him. </span></p></div>
