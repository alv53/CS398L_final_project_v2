light grew brighter. </span><span style="color:brown">Fear urged him to go back, but growth drove him on. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Suddenly he found himself at the mouth of the cave. </span><span style="color:brown">The wall, inside
which he had thought himself, as suddenly leaped back before him to an
immeasurable distance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The light had become painfully bright. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was

trees that fringed the stream, the opposing mountain that towered above
the trees, and the sky that out-towered the mountain. </span></p></div>
