that delayed but did not daunt. </span><span style="color:brown">By the middle of the second day he had
been running continuously for thirty hours, and the iron of his flesh was
giving out. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the endurance of his mind that kept him going. </span><span style="color:brown">He
had not eaten in forty hours, and he was weak with hunger. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The repeated
drenchings in the icy water had likewise had their effect on him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His
handsome coat was draggled. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The broad pads of his feet were bruised and
bleeding. </span><span style="color:brown">He had begun to limp, and this limp increased with the hours. </span><span style="color:brown">To make it worse, the light of the sky was obscured and snow began to

inequalities of the ground so that the way of his feet was more difficult
and painful. </span></p></div>
