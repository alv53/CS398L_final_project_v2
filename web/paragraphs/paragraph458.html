he now received. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Grey Beaver's wrath was terrible; likewise was White
Fang's fright. </span><span style="color:brown">Not only the hand, but the hard wooden paddle was used
upon him; and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was
again flung down in the canoe. </span><span style="color:brown">Again, and this time with purpose, did
Grey Beaver kick him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang did not repeat his attack on the foot. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had learned another lesson of his bondage. </span><span style="color:brown">Never, no matter what the
circumstance, must he dare to bite the god who was lord and master over
him; the body of the lord and master was sacred, not to be defiled by the
teeth of such as he. </span><span style="color:brown">That was evidently the crime of crimes, the one
offence there was no condoning nor overlooking. </span></p></div>
