and himself waging perpetual war, his development was rapid and
one-sided. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This was no soil for kindliness and affection to blossom in. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Of such things he had not the faintest glimmering. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The code he learned
was to obey the strong and to oppress the weak. </span><span style="color:brown">Grey Beaver was a god,
and strong. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Therefore White Fang obeyed him. </span><span style="color:brown">But the dog younger or
smaller than himself was weak, a thing to be destroyed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His development
was in the direction of power. </span><span style="color:brown">In order to face the constant danger of
hurt and even of destruction, his predatory and protective faculties were
unduly developed. </span><span style="color:brown">He became quicker of movement than the other dogs,
swifter of foot, craftier, deadlier, more lithe, more lean with ironlike
muscle and sinew, more enduring, more cruel, more ferocious, and more
intelligent. </span><span style="color:brown">He had to become all these things, else he would not have
held his own nor survive the hostile environment in which he found
himself. </span></p></div>
