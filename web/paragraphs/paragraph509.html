maintained by White Fang amongst his fellows. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never allowed them any
latitude. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He compelled them to an unremitting respect for him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They
might do as they pleased amongst themselves. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">That was no concern of his. </span><span style="color:brown">But it _was_ his concern that they leave him alone in his isolation, get
out of his way when he elected to walk among them, and at all times
acknowledge his mastery over them. </span><span style="color:brown">A hint of stiff-leggedness on their

merciless and cruel, swiftly convincing them of the error of their way. </span></p></div>
