distance. </span><span style="color:brown">Not that he did this consciously, however. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not
calculate such things. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was all automatic. </span><span style="color:brown">His eyes saw correctly,
and the nerves carried the vision correctly to his brain. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The parts of
him were better adjusted than those of the average dog. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They worked
together more smoothly and steadily. </span><span style="color:brown">His was a better, far better,
nervous, mental, and muscular co-ordination. </span><span style="color:brown">When his eyes conveyed to
his brain the moving image of an action, his brain without conscious
effort, knew the space that limited that action and the time required for
its completion. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus, he could avoid the leap of another dog, or the
drive of its fangs, and at the same moment could seize the infinitesimal
fraction of time in which to deliver his own attack. </span><span style="color:brown">Body and brain, his
was a more perfected mechanism. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Not that he was to be praised for it. </span><span style="color:brown">Nature had been more generous to him than to the average animal, that was
all. </span></p></div>
