was better fitted for the life than the other dogs, for he had the
training of his cubhood to guide him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Especially adept did he become in
stalking small living things. </span><span style="color:brown">He would lie concealed for hours,
following every movement of a cautious tree-squirrel, waiting, with a
patience as huge as the hunger he suffered from, until the squirrel
ventured out upon the ground. </span><span style="color:brown">Even then, White Fang was not premature. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He waited until he was sure of striking before the squirrel could gain a
tree-refuge. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, and not until then, would he flash from his hiding-
place, a grey projectile, incredibly swift, never failing its mark--the
fleeing squirrel that fled not fast enough. </span></p></div>
