was man, governing and controlling, expressing himself, as of old, by his
mastery over matter. </span><span style="color:brown">It was colossal, stunning. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang was awed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Fear sat upon him. </span><span style="color:brown">As in his cubhood he had been made to feel his
smallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the Wild to the
village of Grey Beaver, so now, in his full-grown stature and pride of
strength, he was made to feel small and puny. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And there were so many
gods! </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was made dizzy by the swarming of them. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The thunder of the
streets smote upon his ears. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was bewildered by the tremendous and
endless rush and movement of things. </span><span style="color:brown">As never before, he felt his
dependence on the love-master, close at whose heels he followed, no
matter what happened never losing sight of him. </span></p></div>
