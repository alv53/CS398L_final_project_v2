sleep was fitful. </span><span style="color:brown">He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright
world without, where the April sun was blazing across the snow. </span><span style="color:brown">When he
dozed, upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of
running water, and he would rouse and listen intently. </span><span style="color:brown">The sun had come
back, and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Life was
stirring. </span><span style="color:brown">The feel of spring was in the air, the feel of growing life
under the snow, of sap ascending in the trees, of buds bursting the
shackles of the frost. </span></p></div>
