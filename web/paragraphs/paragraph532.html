way to investigate a new tepee which had been erected on the edge of the
village while he was away with the hunters after moose, he came full upon
Kiche. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He paused and looked at her. </span><span style="color:brown">He remembered her vaguely, but he
_remembered_ her, and that was more than could be said for her. </span><span style="color:brown">She
lifted her lip at him in the old snarl of menace, and his memory became
clear. </span><span style="color:brown">His forgotten cubhood, all that was associated with that familiar
snarl, rushed back to him. </span><span style="color:brown">Before he had known the gods, she had been to
him the centre-pin of the universe. </span><span style="color:brown">The old familiar feelings of that
time came back upon him, surged up within him. </span><span style="color:brown">He bounded towards her
joyously, and she met him with shrewd fangs that laid his cheek open to
the bone. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not understand. </span><span style="color:brown">He backed away, bewildered and
puzzled. </span></p></div>
