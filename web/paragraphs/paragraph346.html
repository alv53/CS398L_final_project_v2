experienced the hurt of a fall. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not know what a fall was. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">So he
stepped boldly out upon the air. </span><span style="color:brown">His hind-legs still rested on the cave-
lip, so he fell forward head downward. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The earth struck him a harsh blow
on the nose that made him yelp. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he began rolling down the slope,
over and over. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was in a panic of terror. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The unknown had caught him
at last. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It had gripped savagely hold of him and was about to wreak upon
him some terrific hurt. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Growth was now routed by fear, and he ki-yi'd
