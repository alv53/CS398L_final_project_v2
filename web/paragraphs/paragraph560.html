obeyed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At first this caused trouble for the other dogs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All of them
would spring upon the hated leader only to find the tables turned. </span><span style="color:brown">Behind
him would be Mit-sah, the great whip singing in his hand. </span><span style="color:brown">So the dogs
came to understand that when the team stopped by order, White Fang was to
be let alone. </span><span style="color:brown">But when White Fang stopped without orders, then it was
allowed them to spring upon him and destroy him if they could. </span><span style="color:brown">After
several experiences, White Fang never stopped without orders. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He learned
quickly. </span><span style="color:brown">It was in the nature of things, that he must learn quickly if
he were to survive the unusually severe conditions under which life was
vouchsafed him. </span></p></div>
