him. </span><span style="color:brown">His instinct would not permit him to attack her, while her
persistence would not permit him to ignore her. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">When she rushed at him
he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away
stiff-legged and stately. </span><span style="color:brown">When she forced him too hard, he was compelled
to go about in a circle, his shoulder presented to her, his head turned
from her, and on his face and in his eyes a patient and bored expression. </span><span style="color:brown">Sometimes, however, a nip on his hind-quarters hastened his retreat and
made it anything but stately. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But as a rule he managed to maintain a
dignity that was almost solemnity. </span><span style="color:brown">He ignored her existence whenever it
was possible, and made it a point to keep out of her way. </span><span style="color:brown">When he saw or
heard her coming, he got up and walked off. </span></p></div>
