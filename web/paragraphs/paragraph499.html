in the year and were nine and ten months old, while White Fang was only
eight months old. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Each dog was fastened to the sled by a single rope. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">No
two ropes were of the same length, while the difference in length between
any two ropes was at least that of a dog's body. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Every rope was brought
to a ring at the front end of the sled. </span><span style="color:brown">The sled itself was without
runners, being a birch-bark toboggan, with upturned forward end to keep
it from ploughing under the snow. </span><span style="color:brown">This construction enabled the weight
of the sled and load to be distributed over the largest snow-surface; for
the snow was crystal-powder and very soft. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Observing the same principle
of widest distribution of weight, the dogs at the ends of their ropes
radiated fan-fashion from the nose of the sled, so that no dog trod in
another's footsteps. </span></p></div>
