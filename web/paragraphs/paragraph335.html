cub had learned well the law that forbade his approaching the entrance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Not only had this law been forcibly and many times impressed on him by
his mother's nose and paw, but in him the instinct of fear was
developing. </span><span style="color:brown">Never, in his brief cave-life, had he encountered anything
of which to be afraid. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet fear was in him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It had come down to him
from a remote ancestry through a thousand thousand lives. </span><span style="color:brown">It was a
heritage he had received directly from One Eye and the she-wolf; but to
them, in turn, it had been passed down through all the generations of
wolves that had gone before. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Fear!--that legacy of the Wild which no
animal may escape nor exchange for pottage. </span></p></div>
