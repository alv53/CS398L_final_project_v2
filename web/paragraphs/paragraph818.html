maturity of his years and of the savage rigidity of the mould that had
formed him, his nature was undergoing an expansion. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a
burgeoning within him of strange feelings and unwonted impulses. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His old
code of conduct was changing. </span><span style="color:brown">In the past he had liked comfort and
surcease from pain, disliked discomfort and pain, and he had adjusted his
actions accordingly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But now it was different. </span><span style="color:brown">Because of this new
feeling within him, he ofttimes elected discomfort and pain for the sake
of his god. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Thus, in the early morning, instead of roaming and foraging,
or lying in a sheltered nook, he would wait for hours on the cheerless
cabin-stoop for a sight of the god's face. </span><span style="color:brown">At night, when the god
returned home, White Fang would leave the warm sleeping-place he had
burrowed in the snow in order to receive the friendly snap of fingers and
the word of greeting. </span><span style="color:brown">Meat, even meat itself, he would forego to be with
his god, to receive a caress from him or to accompany him down into the
town. </span></p></div>
