was one of warfare and enmity. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had never learned to play with them. </span><span style="color:brown">He knew only how to fight, and fight with them he did, returning to them
a hundred-fold the snaps and slashes they had given him in the days when
Lip-lip was leader of the pack. </span><span style="color:brown">But Lip-lip was no longer leader--except
when he fled away before his mates at the end of his rope, the sled
bounding along behind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In camp he kept close to Mit-sah or Grey Beaver
or Kloo-kooch. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not dare venture away from the gods, for now the
fangs of all dogs were against him, and he tasted to the dregs the
persecution that had been White Fang's. </span></p></div>
