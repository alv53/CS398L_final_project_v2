dog and man. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came
in from the Wild entered into with man. </span><span style="color:brown">And, like all succeeding wolves
and wild dogs that had done likewise, White Fang worked the covenant out
for himself. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The terms were simple. </span><span style="color:brown">For the possession of a flesh-and-
blood god, he exchanged his own liberty. </span><span style="color:brown">Food and fire, protection and
companionship, were some of the things he received from the god. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In
return, he guarded the god's property, defended his body, worked for him,
and obeyed him. </span></p></div>
