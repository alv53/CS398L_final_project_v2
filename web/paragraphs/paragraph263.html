half and went in different directions. </span><span style="color:brown">The she-wolf, the young leader on
her left, and the one-eyed elder on her right, led their half of the pack
down to the Mackenzie River and across into the lake country to the east. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Each day this remnant of the pack dwindled. </span><span style="color:brown">Two by two, male and female,
the wolves were deserting. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Occasionally a solitary male was driven out
by the sharp teeth of his rivals. </span><span style="color:brown">In the end there remained only four:
the she-wolf, the young leader, the one-eyed one, and the ambitious three-
year-old. </span></p></div>
