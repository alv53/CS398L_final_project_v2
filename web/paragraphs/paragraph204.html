men saw him turn and start to run back toward them. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, approaching at
right angles to the trail and cutting off his retreat they saw a dozen
wolves, lean and grey, bounding across the snow. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">On the instant, the she-
wolf's coyness and playfulness disappeared. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">With a snarl she sprang upon
One Ear. </span><span style="color:brown">He thrust her off with his shoulder, and, his retreat cut off
and still intent on regaining the sled, he altered his course in an
attempt to circle around to it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">More wolves were appearing every moment
and joining in the chase. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The she-wolf was one leap behind One Ear and
holding her own. </span></p></div>
