troubles. </span><span style="color:brown">On her other side ran a gaunt old wolf, grizzled and marked
with the scars of many battles. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He ran always on her right side. </span><span style="color:brown">The
fact that he had but one eye, and that the left eye, might account for
this. </span><span style="color:brown">He, also, was addicted to crowding her, to veering toward her till
his scarred muzzle touched her body, or shoulder, or neck. </span><span style="color:brown">As with the
running mate on the left, she repelled these attentions with her teeth;
but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was roughly
jostled, being compelled, with quick snaps to either side, to drive both
lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward leap with the
pack and see the way of her feet before her. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At such times her running
mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly across at each other. </span><span style="color:brown">They might have fought, but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the
more pressing hunger-need of the pack. </span></p></div>
