already come to recognise his father as the one other dweller in the
world, a creature like his mother, who slept near the light and was a
bringer of meat)--his father had a way of walking right into the white
far wall and disappearing. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The grey cub could not understand this. </span><span style="color:brown">Though never permitted by his mother to approach that wall, he had
approached the other walls, and encountered hard obstruction on the end
of his tender nose. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This hurt. </span><span style="color:brown">And after several such adventures, he
left the walls alone. </span><span style="color:brown">Without thinking about it, he accepted this
disappearing into the wall as a peculiarity of his father, as milk and
half-digested meat were peculiarities of his mother. </span></p></div>
