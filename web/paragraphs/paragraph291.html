where its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape. </span><span style="color:brown">Returning
to the cave, she entered its narrow mouth. </span><span style="color:brown">For a short three feet she
was compelled to crouch, then the walls widened and rose higher in a
little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The roof barely
cleared her head. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was dry and cosey. </span><span style="color:brown">She inspected it with
painstaking care, while One Eye, who had returned, stood in the entrance
and patiently watched her. </span><span style="color:brown">She dropped her head, with her nose to the
ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet, and
around this point she circled several times; then, with a tired sigh that
was almost a grunt, she curled her body in, relaxed her legs, and dropped
down, her head toward the entrance. </span><span style="color:brown">One Eye, with pointed, interested
ears, laughed at her, and beyond, outlined against the white light, she
could see the brush of his tail waving good-naturedly. </span><span style="color:brown">Her own ears,
with a snuggling movement, laid their sharp points backward and down
against the head for a moment, while her mouth opened and her tongue
lolled peaceably out, and in this way she expressed that she was pleased
and satisfied. </span></p></div>
