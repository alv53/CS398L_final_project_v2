tasted and swallowed. </span><span style="color:brown">This served as a relish, and his hunger increased
mightily; but he was too old in the world to forget his caution. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
waited. </span><span style="color:brown">He lay down and waited, while the porcupine grated its teeth and
uttered grunts and sobs and occasional sharp little squeals. </span><span style="color:brown">In a little
while, One Eye noticed that the quills were drooping and that a great
quivering had set up. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The quivering came to an end suddenly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was

quite down, and the body relaxed and moved no more. </span></p></div>
