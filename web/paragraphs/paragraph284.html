sat down in the snow, and old One Eye, now more in fear of his mate than
of the mysterious sapling, again sprang for the rabbit. </span><span style="color:brown">As he sank back
with it between his teeth, he kept his eye on the sapling. </span><span style="color:brown">As before, it
followed him back to earth. </span><span style="color:brown">He crouched down under the impending blow,
his hair bristling, but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the blow did not fall. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The sapling remained bent above him. </span><span style="color:brown">When he
moved it moved, and he growled at it through his clenched jaws; when he
remained still, it remained still, and he concluded it was safer to
continue remaining still. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good
in his mouth. </span></p></div>
