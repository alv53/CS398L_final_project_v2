not touch. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were cats at the houses the master visited that must be
let alone. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that
he must not attack. </span><span style="color:brown">And then, on the crowded sidewalks there were
persons innumerable whose attention he attracted. </span><span style="color:brown">They would stop and
look at him, point him out to one another, examine him, talk of him, and,
worst of all, pat him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And these perilous contacts from all these
strange hands he must endure. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Yet this endurance he achieved. </span><span style="color:brown">Furthermore, he got over being awkward and self-conscious. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In a lofty
way he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">With
condescension he accepted their condescension. </span><span style="color:brown">On the other hand, there
was something about him that prevented great familiarity. </span><span style="color:brown">They patted
him on the head and passed on, contented and pleased with their own
daring. </span></p></div>
