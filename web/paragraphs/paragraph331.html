appearing and disappearing in the wall nor lying down asleep in the
entrance. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This had happened at the end of a second and less severe
famine. </span><span style="color:brown">The she-wolf knew why One Eye never came back, but there was no
way by which she could tell what she had seen to the grey cub. </span><span style="color:brown">Hunting
herself for meat, up the left fork of the stream where lived the lynx,
she had followed a day-old trail of One Eye. </span><span style="color:brown">And she had found him, or
what remained of him, at the end of the trail. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There were many signs of
the battle that had been fought, and of the lynx's withdrawal to her lair
after having won the victory. </span><span style="color:brown">Before she went away, the she-wolf had
found this lair, but the signs told her that the lynx was inside, and she
had not dared to venture in. </span></p></div>
