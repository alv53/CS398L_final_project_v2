there three years. </span><span style="color:brown">The cell was of iron, the floor, the walls, the roof. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never left this cell. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He never saw the sky nor the sunshine. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Day was
a twilight and night was a black silence. </span><span style="color:brown">He was in an iron tomb, buried
alive. </span><span style="color:brown">He saw no human face, spoke to no human thing. </span><span style="color:brown">When his food was
shoved in to him, he growled like a wild animal. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He hated all things. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">For days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe. </span><span style="color:brown">For weeks and
months he never made a sound, in the black silence eating his very soul. </span><span style="color:brown">He was a man and a monstrosity, as fearful a thing of fear as ever
gibbered in the visions of a maddened brain. </span></p></div>
