of the shoulders with hands that rubbed against the grain of the hair and
that made slight, pushing-forward movements. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">These were so many
suggestions. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, their effect was irritating, for Cherokee began to
growl, very softly, deep down in his throat. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a correspondence
in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the man's hands. </span><span style="color:brown">The
growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forward-pushing
movement, and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the
next movement. </span><span style="color:brown">The end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm,
the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk. </span></p></div>
