one of White Fang's chief duties in life. </span><span style="color:brown">In the Northland he had
evidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness; but there were no sleds
in the Southland, nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">So he
rendered fealty in the new way, by running with the master's horse. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The
longest day never played White Fang out. </span><span style="color:brown">His was the gait of the wolf,
smooth, tireless and effortless, and at the end of fifty miles he would
come in jauntily ahead of the horse. </span></p></div>
