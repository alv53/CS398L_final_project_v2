that was almost as great a beast as he. </span><span style="color:brown">The guard treated him unfairly,
lied about him to the warden, lost his credits, persecuted him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The
difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of keys and a
revolver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Jim Hall had only his naked hands and his teeth. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he
sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the other's throat
just like any jungle animal. </span></p></div>
