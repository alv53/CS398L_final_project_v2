and more ferocious than it was his natural right to be. </span><span style="color:brown">Savageness was a
part of his make-up, but the savageness thus developed exceeded his make-
up. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He acquired a reputation for wickedness amongst the man-animals
themselves. </span><span style="color:brown">Wherever there was trouble and uproar in camp, fighting and
squabbling or the outcry of a squaw over a bit of stolen meat, they were
sure to find White Fang mixed up in it and usually at the bottom of it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They did not bother to look after the causes of his conduct. </span><span style="color:brown">They saw
only the effects, and the effects were bad. </span><span style="color:brown">He was a sneak and a thief,
a mischief-maker, a fomenter of trouble; and irate squaws told him to his
face, the while he eyed them alert and ready to dodge any quick-flung
missile, that he was a wolf and worthless and bound to come to an evil
end. </span></p></div>
