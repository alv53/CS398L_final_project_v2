in camp. </span><span style="color:brown">The intent of the snarl is to warn or frighten, and judgment is
required to know when it should be used. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang knew how to make it
and when to make it. </span><span style="color:brown">Into his snarl he incorporated all that was
vicious, malignant, and horrible. </span><span style="color:brown">With nose serrulated by continuous
spasms, hair bristling in recurrent waves, tongue whipping out like a red
snake and whipping back again, ears flattened down, eyes gleaming hatred,
lips wrinkled back, and fangs exposed and dripping, he could compel a
pause on the part of almost any assailant. </span><span style="color:brown">A temporary pause, when taken
off his guard, gave him the vital moment in which to think and determine
his action. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But often a pause so gained lengthened out until it evolved
into a complete cessation from the attack. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And before more than one of
the grown dogs White Fang's snarl enabled him to beat an honourable
retreat. </span></p></div>
