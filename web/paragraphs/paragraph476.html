they realised their play in this mimic warfare. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus it was that the
hunt of White Fang became their chief game--a deadly game, withal, and at
all times a serious game. </span><span style="color:brown">He, on the other hand, being the
fastest-footed, was unafraid to venture anywhere. </span><span style="color:brown">During the period that
he waited vainly for his mother to come back, he led the pack many a wild
chase through the adjacent woods. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the pack invariably lost him. </span><span style="color:brown">Its
noise and outcry warned him of its presence, while he ran alone, velvet-
footed, silently, a moving shadow among the trees after the manner of his
father and mother before him. </span><span style="color:brown">Further he was more directly connected
with the Wild than they; and he knew more of its secrets and stratagems. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A favourite trick of his was to lose his trail in running water and then
lie quietly in a near-by thicket while their baffled cries arose around
him. </span></p></div>
