entrance. </span><span style="color:brown">When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair, he again
sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was a new
note in his mate's warning snarl. </span><span style="color:brown">It was a jealous note, and he was very

sheltering between her legs against the length of her body, five strange
little bundles of life, very feeble, very helpless, making tiny

that this thing had happened. </span><span style="color:brown">It had happened many times, yet each time
