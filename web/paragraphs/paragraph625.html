of them raged against each other unceasingly. </span><span style="color:brown">In the days before, White
Fang had had the wisdom to cower down and submit to a man with a club in
his hand; but this wisdom now left him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The mere sight of Beauty Smith
was sufficient to send him into transports of fury. </span><span style="color:brown">And when they came
to close quarters, and he had been beaten back by the club, he went on
growling and snarling, and showing his fangs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The last growl could never
be extracted from him. </span><span style="color:brown">No matter how terribly he was beaten, he had
always another growl; and when Beauty Smith gave up and withdrew, the
defiant growl followed after him, or White Fang sprang at the bars of the
cage bellowing his hatred. </span></p></div>
