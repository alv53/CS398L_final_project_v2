a number of men gathered about the pen. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Beauty Smith entered, club in
hand, and took the chain off from White Fang's neck. </span><span style="color:brown">When his master had
gone out, White Fang turned loose and tore around the pen, trying to get
at the men outside. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He was magnificently terrible. </span><span style="color:brown">Fully five feet in
length, and standing two and one-half feet at the shoulder, he far
outweighed a wolf of corresponding size. </span><span style="color:brown">From his mother he had
inherited the heavier proportions of the dog, so that he weighed, without
any fat and without an ounce of superfluous flesh, over ninety pounds. </span><span style="color:brown">It
was all muscle, bone, and sinew-fighting flesh in the finest condition. </span></p></div>
