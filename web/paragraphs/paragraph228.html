sleep was becoming overpowering. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The snarling of his dogs was losing its
efficacy. </span><span style="color:brown">Besides, they were snarling all the time, and his benumbed and
drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
