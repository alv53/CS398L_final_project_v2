tail rigidly erect, keeping his eyes on Dick to guard against a flank
attack, and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation
of the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the
house. </span><span style="color:brown">But no thing of fear pounced out, and when he had gained the
inside he scouted carefully around, looking at it and finding it not. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he lay down with a contented grunt at the master's feet, observing
all that went on, ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life
with the terrors he felt must lurk under the trap-roof of the dwelling. </span></p></div>
