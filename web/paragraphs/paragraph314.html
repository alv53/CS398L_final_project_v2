full length and turned it over on its back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Nothing had happened. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It
was surely dead. </span><span style="color:brown">He studied it intently for a moment, then took a
careful grip with his teeth and started off down the stream, partly
carrying, partly dragging the porcupine, with head turned to the side so
as to avoid stepping on the prickly mass. </span><span style="color:brown">He recollected something,
dropped the burden, and trotted back to where he had left the ptarmigan. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did not hesitate a moment. </span><span style="color:brown">He knew clearly what was to be done, and
this he did by promptly eating the ptarmigan. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then he returned and took
