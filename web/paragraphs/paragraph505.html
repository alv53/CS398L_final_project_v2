than the other dogs in the yielding of himself to the rule of the gods,
and he had learned more thoroughly the futility of opposing their will. </span><span style="color:brown">In addition, the persecution he had suffered from the pack had made the
pack less to him in the scheme of things, and man more. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had not
learned to be dependent on his kind for companionship. </span><span style="color:brown">Besides, Kiche
was well-nigh forgotten; and the chief outlet of expression that remained
to him was in the allegiance he tendered the gods he had accepted as
masters. </span><span style="color:brown">So he worked hard, learned discipline, and was obedient. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Faithfulness and willingness characterised his toil. </span><span style="color:brown">These are essential
traits of the wolf and the wild-dog when they have become domesticated,
and these traits White Fang possessed in unusual measure. </span></p></div>
