suffered from one besetting weakness. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could not stand being laughed
at. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The laughter of men was a hateful thing. </span><span style="color:brown">They might laugh among
themselves about anything they pleased except himself, and he did not
mind. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the moment laughter was turned upon him he would fly into a
most terrible rage. </span><span style="color:brown">Grave, dignified, sombre, a laugh made him frantic
to ridiculousness. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It so outraged him and upset him that for hours he
would behave like a demon. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And woe to the dog that at such times ran
foul of him. </span><span style="color:brown">He knew the law too well to take it out of Grey Beaver;
behind Grey Beaver were a club and godhead. </span><span style="color:brown">But behind the dogs there
was nothing but space, and into this space they flew when White Fang came
on the scene, made mad by laughter. </span></p></div>
