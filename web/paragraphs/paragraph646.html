but the difference in their height was too great. </span><span style="color:brown">Cherokee was too
squat, too close to the ground. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang tried the trick once too
often. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The chance came in one of his quick doublings and
counter-circlings. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He caught Cherokee with head turned away as he
whirled more slowly. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His shoulder was exposed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang drove in upon
it: but his own shoulder was high above, while he struck with such force
that his momentum carried him on across over the other's body. </span><span style="color:brown">For the
first time in his fighting history, men saw White Fang lose his footing. </span><span style="color:brown">His body turned a half-somersault in the air, and he would have landed on
his back had he not twisted, catlike, still in the air, in the effort to
bring his feet to the earth. </span><span style="color:brown">As it was, he struck heavily on his side. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The next instant he was on his feet, but in that instant Cherokee's teeth
closed on his throat. </span></p></div>
