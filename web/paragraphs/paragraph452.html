physical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her. </span><span style="color:brown">Unseen and occultly, the gods still gripped with their power and would
not let her go. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang sat down in the shadow of a birch and
whimpered softly. </span><span style="color:brown">There was a strong smell of pine, and subtle wood
fragrances filled the air, reminding him of his old life of freedom
before the days of his bondage. </span><span style="color:brown">But he was still only a part-grown
puppy, and stronger than the call either of man or of the Wild was the
call of his mother. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All the hours of his short life he had depended upon
her. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The time was yet to come for independence. </span><span style="color:brown">So he arose and trotted
forlornly back to camp, pausing once, and twice, to sit down and whimper
and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths of the forest. </span></p></div>
