softly up at the thing of fear, watching keenly the deportment of the
hands. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">One hand extended outward and began to descend upon his head. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His
soft snarl grew tense and harsh. </span><span style="color:brown">The hand continued slowly to descend,
while he crouched beneath it, eyeing it malignantly, his snarl growing
shorter and shorter as, with quickening breath, it approached its
culmination. </span><span style="color:brown">Suddenly he snapped, striking with his fangs like a snake. </span><span style="color:brown">The hand was jerked back, and the teeth came together emptily with a
sharp click. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Beauty Smith was frightened and angry. </span><span style="color:brown">Grey Beaver clouted

in respectful obedience. </span></p></div>
