clanking, clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal
screaming lynxes. </span><span style="color:brown">He would lie in a screen of bushes, watching for a
squirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its tree-refuge. </span><span style="color:brown">Then, when he sprang out upon it, it would transform itself into an
electric car, menacing and terrible, towering over him like a mountain,
screaming and clanging and spitting fire at him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was the same when he
challenged the hawk down out of the sky. </span><span style="color:brown">Down out of the blue it would
rush, as it dropped upon him changing itself into the ubiquitous electric
car. </span><span style="color:brown">Or again, he would be in the pen of Beauty Smith. </span><span style="color:brown">Outside the pen,
men would be gathering, and he knew that a fight was on. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He watched the

ever. </span></p></div>
