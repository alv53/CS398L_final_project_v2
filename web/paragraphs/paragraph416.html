reached out to him and rolled him over on his back. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Kiche looked on
anxiously. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang felt fear mounting in him again. </span><span style="color:brown">He could not
quite suppress a snarl, but he made no offer to snap. </span><span style="color:brown">The hand, with
fingers crooked and spread apart, rubbed his stomach in a playful way and
rolled him from side to side. </span><span style="color:brown">It was ridiculous and ungainly, lying
there on his back with legs sprawling in the air. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Besides, it was a
position of such utter helplessness that White Fang's whole nature
revolted against it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could do nothing to defend himself. </span><span style="color:brown">If this man-
animal intended harm, White Fang knew that he could not escape it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">How
could he spring away with his four legs in the air above him? </span><span style="color:brown">Yet
submission made him master his fear, and he only growled softly. </span><span style="color:brown">This
growl he could not suppress; nor did the man-animal resent it by giving
him a blow on the head. </span><span style="color:brown">And furthermore, such was the strangeness of it,
White Fang experienced an unaccountable sensation of pleasure as the hand
rubbed back and forth. </span><span style="color:brown">When he was rolled on his side he ceased to
growl, when the fingers pressed and prodded at the base of his ears the
pleasurable sensation increased; and when, with a final rub and scratch,
the man left him alone and went away, all fear had died out of White
Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">He was to know fear many times in his dealing with man; yet it was
a token of the fearless companionship with man that was ultimately to be
his. </span></p></div>
