creature. </span><span style="color:brown">He asked no quarter, gave none. </span><span style="color:brown">He was continually marred and
scarred by the teeth of the pack, and as continually he left his own
marks upon the pack. </span><span style="color:brown">Unlike most leaders, who, when camp was made and
the dogs were unhitched, huddled near to the gods for protection, White
Fang disdained such protection. </span><span style="color:brown">He walked boldly about the camp,
inflicting punishment in the night for what he had suffered in the day. </span><span style="color:brown">In the time before he was made leader of the team, the pack had learned
to get out of his way. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But now it was different. </span><span style="color:brown">Excited by the day-
long pursuit of him, swayed subconsciously by the insistent iteration on
their brains of the sight of him fleeing away, mastered by the feeling of
mastery enjoyed all day, the dogs could not bring themselves to give way
to him. </span><span style="color:brown">When he appeared amongst them, there was always a squabble. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His
progress was marked by snarl and snap and growl. </span><span style="color:brown">The very atmosphere he
breathed was surcharged with hatred and malice, and this but served to
increase the hatred and malice within him. </span></p></div>
