pack. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he was too morose and solitary for that. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He merely thrashed
his team-mates. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Otherwise he ignored them. </span><span style="color:brown">They got out of his way when
he came along; nor did the boldest of them ever dare to rob him of his
meat. </span><span style="color:brown">On the contrary, they devoured their own meat hurriedly, for fear
that he would take it away from them. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang knew the law well: _to
oppress the weak and obey the strong_. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He ate his share of meat as
rapidly as he could. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And then woe the dog that had not yet finished! </span><span style="color:brown">A
snarl and a flash of fangs, and that dog would wail his indignation to
the uncomforting stars while White Fang finished his portion for him. </span></p></div>
