and comfortable, and he was playing cribbage with the Factor. </span><span style="color:brown">Also, it
seemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves. </span><span style="color:brown">They were howling at
the very gates, and sometimes he and the Factor paused from the game to
listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in. </span><span style="color:brown">And
then, so strange was the dream, there was a crash. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The door was burst
open. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He could see the wolves flooding into the big living-room of the
fort. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">They were leaping straight for him and the Factor. </span><span style="color:brown">With the
bursting open of the door, the noise of their howling had increased
tremendously. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This howling now bothered him. </span><span style="color:brown">His dream was merging into
something else--he knew not what; but through it all, following him,
persisted the howling. </span></p></div>
