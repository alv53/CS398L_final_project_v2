runners under them. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And different was the method of driving the dogs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">There was no fan-formation of the team. </span><span style="color:brown">The dogs worked in single file,
one behind another, hauling on double traces. </span><span style="color:brown">And here, in the Klondike,
the leader was indeed the leader. </span><span style="color:brown">The wisest as well as strongest dog
was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">That White Fang
should quickly gain this post was inevitable. </span><span style="color:brown">He could not be satisfied
with less, as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble. </span><span style="color:brown">White
Fang picked out the post for himself, and Matt backed his judgment with
strong language after the experiment had been tried. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But, though he
worked in the sled in the day, White Fang did not forego the guarding of
his master's property in the night. </span><span style="color:brown">Thus he was on duty all the time,
ever vigilant and faithful, the most valuable of all the dogs. </span></p></div>
