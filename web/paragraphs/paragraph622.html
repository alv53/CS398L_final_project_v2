around his pen. </span><span style="color:brown">It meant a fight; and this was the only way that was now
vouchsafed him of expressing the life that was in him. </span><span style="color:brown">Tormented,
incited to hate, he was kept a prisoner so that there was no way of
satisfying that hate except at the times his master saw fit to put
another dog against him. </span><span style="color:brown">Beauty Smith had estimated his powers well, for
he was invariably the victor. </span><span style="color:brown">One day, three dogs were turned in upon
him in succession. </span><span style="color:brown">Another day a full-grown wolf, fresh-caught from the
Wild, was shoved in through the door of the pen. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And on still another
day two dogs were set against him at the same time. </span><span style="color:brown">This was his
severest fight, and though in the end he killed them both he was himself
half killed in doing it. </span></p></div>
