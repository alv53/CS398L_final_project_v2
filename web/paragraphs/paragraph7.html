their bodies. </span><span style="color:brown">On every side was the silence, pressing upon them with a
tangible presence. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of
deep water affect the body of the diver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It crushed them with the weight
of unending vastness and unalterable decree. </span><span style="color:brown">It crushed them into the
remotest recesses of their own minds, pressing out of them, like juices
from the grape, all the false ardours and exaltations and undue
self-values of the human soul, until they perceived themselves finite and
small, specks and motes, moving with weak cunning and little wisdom
amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and forces. </span></p></div>
