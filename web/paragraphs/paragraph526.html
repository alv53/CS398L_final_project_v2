learned of the changed relations in which he stood to the dog-world. </span><span style="color:brown">He
had got for himself a hoof and part of the shin-bone, to which quite a
bit of meat was attached. </span><span style="color:brown">Withdrawn from the immediate scramble of the
other dogs--in fact out of sight behind a thicket--he was devouring his
prize, when Baseek rushed in upon him. </span><span style="color:brown">Before he knew what he was doing,
he had slashed the intruder twice and sprung clear. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Baseek was surprised
by the other's temerity and swiftness of attack. </span><span style="color:brown">He stood, gazing
stupidly across at White Fang, the raw, red shin-bone between them. </span></p></div>
