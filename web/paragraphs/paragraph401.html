cub. </span><span style="color:brown">As the hand descended closer and closer, there raged within the cub
a battle of the instincts. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He experienced two great impulsions--to yield
and to fight. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The resulting action was a compromise. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did both. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
yielded till the hand almost touched him. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he fought, his teeth
flashing in a snap that sank them into the hand. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The next moment he
received a clout alongside the head that knocked him over on his side. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then all fight fled out of him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His puppyhood and the instinct of
submission took charge of him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He sat up on his haunches and ki-yi'd. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But the man whose hand he had bitten was angry. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The cub received a clout
on the other side of his head. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Whereupon he sat up and ki-yi'd louder
than ever. </span></p></div>
