motionless, waiting the will of Grey Beaver. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was Grey Beaver's will
that he should go ashore, for ashore he was flung, striking heavily on
his side and hurting his bruises afresh. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He crawled tremblingly to his
feet and stood whimpering. </span><span style="color:brown">Lip-lip, who had watched the whole proceeding
from the bank, now rushed upon him, knocking him over and sinking his
teeth into him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang was too helpless to defend himself, and it
would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver's foot shot out,
lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to
earth a dozen feet away. </span><span style="color:brown">This was the man-animal's justice; and even
then, in his own pitiable plight, White Fang experienced a little
grateful thrill. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At Grey Beaver's heels he limped obediently through the
village to the tepee. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And so it came that White Fang learned that the
right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied
to the lesser creatures under them. </span></p></div>
