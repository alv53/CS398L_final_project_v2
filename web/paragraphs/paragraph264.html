all bore the marks of her teeth. </span><span style="color:brown">Yet they never replied in kind, never
defended themselves against her. </span><span style="color:brown">They turned their shoulders to her most
savage slashes, and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to
placate her wrath. </span><span style="color:brown">But if they were all mildness toward her, they were
all fierceness toward one another. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The three-year-old grew too ambitious
in his fierceness. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He caught the one-eyed elder on his blind side and
ripped his ear into ribbons. </span><span style="color:brown">Though the grizzled old fellow could see
only on one side, against the youth and vigour of the other he brought
into play the wisdom of long years of experience. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">His lost eye and his
scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his experience. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He had
