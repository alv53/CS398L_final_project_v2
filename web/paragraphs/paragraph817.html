he knew not what love was. </span><span style="color:brown">It manifested itself to him as a void in his
being--a hungry, aching, yearning void that clamoured to be filled. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It
was a pain and an unrest; and it received easement only by the touch of
the new god's presence. </span><span style="color:brown">At such times love was joy to him, a wild, keen-
thrilling satisfaction. </span><span style="color:brown">But when away from his god, the pain and the
unrest returned; the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with
its emptiness, and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly. </span></p></div>
