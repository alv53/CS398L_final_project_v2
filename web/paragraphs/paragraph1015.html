a moment's peace. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">She was not so amenable to the law as he. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">She defied
all efforts of the master to make her become friends with White Fang. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl. </span><span style="color:brown">She had never
forgiven him the chicken-killing episode, and persistently held to the
belief that his intentions were bad. </span><span style="color:brown">She found him guilty before the
act, and treated him accordingly. </span><span style="color:brown">She became a pest to him, like a
policeman following him around the stable and the hounds, and, if he even
so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken, bursting into an
outcry of indignation and wrath. </span><span style="color:brown">His favourite way of ignoring her was
