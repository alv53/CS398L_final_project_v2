applied his teeth to the stick that held him. </span><span style="color:brown">The wood was seasoned and
dry, and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get
his teeth to it. </span><span style="color:brown">It was only by the severest muscular exertion and neck-
arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth, and
barely between his teeth at that; and it was only by the exercise of an
immense patience, extending through many hours, that he succeeded in
gnawing through the stick. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This was something that dogs were not
supposed to do. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was unprecedented. </span><span style="color:brown">But White Fang did it, trotting
away from the fort in the early morning, with the end of the stick
hanging to his neck. </span></p></div>
