Beauty Smith, White Fang remained. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In acknowledgment of fealty, he
proceeded to take upon himself the guardianship of his master's property. </span><span style="color:brown">He prowled about the cabin while the sled-dogs slept, and the first night-
visitor to the cabin fought him off with a club until Weedon Scott came
to the rescue. </span><span style="color:brown">But White Fang soon learned to differentiate between
thieves and honest men, to appraise the true value of step and carriage. </span><span style="color:brown">The man who travelled, loud-stepping, the direct line to the cabin door,
he let alone--though he watched him vigilantly until the door opened and
he received the endorsement of the master. </span><span style="color:brown">But the man who went softly,
by circuitous ways, peering with caution, seeking after secrecy--that was
the man who received no suspension of judgment from White Fang, and who
