kept chained in a pen at the rear of the fort, and here Beauty Smith
teased and irritated and drove him wild with petty torments. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The man

uproarious and scornful, and at the same time the god pointed his finger
derisively at White Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">At such times reason fled from White Fang, and
in his transports of rage he was even more mad than Beauty Smith. </span></p></div>
