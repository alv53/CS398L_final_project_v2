the dogs up, but he had tied them, after the Indian fashion, with sticks. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">About the neck of each dog he had fastened a leather thong. </span><span style="color:brown">To this, and
so close to the neck that the dog could not get his teeth to it, he had
tied a stout stick four or five feet in length. </span><span style="color:brown">The other end of the
stick, in turn, was made fast to a stake in the ground by means of a
leather thong. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The dog was unable to gnaw through the leather at his own
end of the stick. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The stick prevented him from getting at the leather
that fastened the other end. </span></p></div>
