which he calmly accepted White Fang as an addition to the premises. </span><span style="color:brown">Had
Dick had his way, they would have been good friends; but White Fang
was averse to friendship. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All he asked of other dogs was to be let
alone. </span><span style="color:brown">His whole life he had kept aloof from his kind, and he still
desired to keep aloof. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Dick's overtures bothered him, so he snarled Dick
away. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">In the north he had learned the lesson that he must let the
master's dogs alone, and he did not forget that lesson now. </span><span style="color:brown">But he
insisted on his own privacy and self-seclusion, and so thoroughly ignored
Dick that that good-natured creature finally gave him up and scarcely
took as much interest in him as in the hitching-post near the stable. </span></p></div>
