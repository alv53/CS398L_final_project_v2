tepees, and this the boy guarded. </span><span style="color:brown">Holding his club prepared to strike,
he drew in on his cornered quarry. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang was furious. </span><span style="color:brown">He faced the
boy, bristling and snarling, his sense of justice outraged. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He knew the
law of forage. </span><span style="color:brown">All the wastage of meat, such as the frozen chips,
belonged to the dog that found it. </span><span style="color:brown">He had done no wrong, broken no law,
yet here was this boy preparing to give him a beating. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang
scarcely knew what happened. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He did it in a surge of rage. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">And he did
it so quickly that the boy did not know either. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">All the boy knew was
that he had in some unaccountable way been overturned into the snow, and
that his club-hand had been ripped wide open by White Fang's teeth. </span></p></div>
