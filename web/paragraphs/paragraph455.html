that, White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Varying were the emotions that surged through him. </span><span style="color:brown">At first, he had

to the impact of the hand. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But this was quickly followed by anger. </span><span style="color:brown">His
free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled
fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This but served to make the
