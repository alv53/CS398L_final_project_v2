another great journey, and long remembered was the havoc he worked
amongst the dogs of the many villages along the Mackenzie, across the
Rockies, and down the Porcupine to the Yukon. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He revelled in the
vengeance he wreaked upon his kind. </span><span style="color:brown">They were ordinary, unsuspecting
dogs. </span><span style="color:brown">They were not prepared for his swiftness and directness, for his
attack without warning. </span><span style="color:brown">They did not know him for what he was, a
lightning-flash of slaughter. </span><span style="color:brown">They bristled up to him, stiff-legged and
challenging, while he, wasting no time on elaborate preliminaries,
snapping into action like a steel spring, was at their throats and
destroying them before they knew what was happening and while they were
yet in the throes of surprise. </span></p></div>
