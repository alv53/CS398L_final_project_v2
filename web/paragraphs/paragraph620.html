unusual was happening. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He waited. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The door was opened wider. </span><span style="color:brown">Then a
huge dog was thrust inside, and the door was slammed shut behind him. </span><span style="color:brown">White Fang had never seen such a dog (it was a mastiff); but the size and
fierce aspect of the intruder did not deter him. </span><span style="color:brown">Here was some thing,
not wood nor iron, upon which to wreak his hate. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He leaped in with a
flash of fangs that ripped down the side of the mastiff's neck. </span><span style="color:brown">The
mastiff shook his head, growled hoarsely, and plunged at White Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">But
White Fang was here, there, and everywhere, always evading and eluding,
and always leaping in and slashing with his fangs and leaping out again
in time to escape punishment. </span></p></div>
