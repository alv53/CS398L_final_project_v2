learned thoroughly that they must stay together. </span><span style="color:brown">He attacked them when
he caught them alone, and they attacked him when they were bunched. </span><span style="color:brown">The
sight of him was sufficient to start them rushing after him, at which
times his swiftness usually carried him into safety. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But woe the dog
that outran his fellows in such pursuit! </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang had learned to turn
suddenly upon the pursuer that was ahead of the pack and thoroughly to
rip him up before the pack could arrive. </span><span style="color:brown">This occurred with great
frequency, for, once in full cry, the dogs were prone to forget
themselves in the excitement of the chase, while White Fang never forgot
himself. </span><span style="color:brown">Stealing backward glances as he ran, he was always ready to
whirl around and down the overzealous pursuer that outran his fellows. </span></p></div>
