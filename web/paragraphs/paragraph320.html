the rest. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">This was the mouth of the cave and the source of light. </span><span style="color:brown">He
had discovered that it was different from the other walls long before he
had any thoughts of his own, any conscious volitions. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It had been an
irresistible attraction before ever his eyes opened and looked upon it. </span><span style="color:brown">The light from it had beat upon his sealed lids, and the eyes and the
optic nerves had pulsated to little, sparklike flashes, warm-coloured and
strangely pleasing. </span><span style="color:brown">The life of his body, and of every fibre of his
body, the life that was the very substance of his body and that was apart
from his own personal life, had yearned toward this light and urged his
