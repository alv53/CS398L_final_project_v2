nothing, and he could not understand. </span><span style="color:brown">Never, in all his fighting, had
this thing happened. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The dogs he had fought with did not fight that way. </span><span style="color:brown">With them it was snap and slash and get away, snap and slash and get
away. </span><span style="color:brown">He lay partly on his side, panting for breath. </span><span style="color:brown">Cherokee still
