into the woods. </span><span style="color:brown">It was the afternoon that the master was to ride, and
White Fang knew it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The horse stood saddled and waiting at the door. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang hesitated. </span><span style="color:brown">But there was that in him deeper than all the law
