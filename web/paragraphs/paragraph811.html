he now did; but all the currents had gone counter to those to which he
now abandoned himself. </span><span style="color:brown">In short, when all things were considered, he had
to achieve an orientation far vaster than the one he had achieved at the
time he came voluntarily in from the Wild and accepted Grey Beaver as his
lord. </span><span style="color:brown">At that time he was a mere puppy, soft from the making, without
form, ready for the thumb of circumstance to begin its work upon him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But
now it was different. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">The thumb of circumstance had done its work only
too well. </span><span style="color:brown">By it he had been formed and hardened into the Fighting Wolf,
fierce and implacable, unloving and unlovable. </span><span style="color:brown">To accomplish the change
was like a reflux of being, and this when the plasticity of youth was no
longer his; when the fibre of him had become tough and knotty; when the
warp and the woof of him had made of him an adamantine texture, harsh and
unyielding; when the face of his spirit had become iron and all his
instincts and axioms had crystallised into set rules, cautions, dislikes,
and desires. </span></p></div>
