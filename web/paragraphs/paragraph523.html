journey. </span><span style="color:brown">It was April, and White Fang was a year old when he pulled into
the home villages and was loosed from the harness by Mit-sah. </span><span style="color:brown">Though a
long way from his full growth, White Fang, next to Lip-lip, was the
largest yearling in the village. </span><span style="color:brown">Both from his father, the wolf, and
from Kiche, he had inherited stature and strength, and already he was
measuring up alongside the full-grown dogs. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But he had not yet grown
compact. </span><span style="color:brown">His body was slender and rangy, and his strength more stringy
than massive. </span><span style="color:brown">His coat was the true wolf-grey, and to all appearances he
was true wolf himself. </span><span style="color:brown">The quarter-strain of dog he had inherited from
Kiche had left no mark on him physically, though it had played its part
in his mental make-up. </span></p></div>
