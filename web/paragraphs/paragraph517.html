sah, alone, gathering firewood in the forest, encountered the boy that
had been bitten. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">With him were other boys. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Hot words passed. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Then all
the boys attacked Mit-sah. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was going hard with him. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Blows were
raining upon him from all sides. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">White Fang looked on at first. </span><span style="color:brown">This
was an affair of the gods, and no concern of his. </span><span style="color:brown">Then he realised that
this was Mit-sah, one of his own particular gods, who was being
maltreated. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">It was no reasoned impulse that made White Fang do what he
then did. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">A mad rush of anger sent him leaping in amongst the
combatants. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Five minutes later the landscape was covered with fleeing
boys, many of whom dripped blood upon the snow in token that White Fang's
teeth had not been idle. </span><span style="color:brown">When Mit-sah told the story in camp, Grey
Beaver ordered meat to be given to White Fang. </span><span style="color:brown">He ordered much meat to
be given, and White Fang, gorged and sleepy by the fire, knew that the
law had received its verification. </span></p></div>
