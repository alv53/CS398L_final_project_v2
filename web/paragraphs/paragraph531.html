a greater pride. </span><span style="color:brown">He walked less softly among the grown dogs; his
attitude toward them was less compromising. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Not that he went out of his
way looking for trouble. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">Far from it. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">But upon his way he demanded
consideration. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He stood upon his right to go his way unmolested and to
give trail to no dog. </span><span style="color:brown">He had to be taken into account, that was all. </span><span style="color:brown">He
was no longer to be disregarded and ignored, as was the lot of puppies,
and as continued to be the lot of the puppies that were his team-mates. </span><span style="color:brown">They got out of the way, gave trail to the grown dogs, and gave up meat
to them under compulsion. </span><span style="color:brown">But White Fang, uncompanionable, solitary,
morose, scarcely looking to right or left, redoubtable, forbidding of
aspect, remote and alien, was accepted as an equal by his puzzled elders. </span><span style="color:brown">They quickly learned to leave him alone, neither venturing hostile acts
nor making overtures of friendliness. </span><span style="color:brown">If they left him alone, he left
them alone--a state of affairs that they found, after a few encounters,
to be pre-eminently desirable. </span></p></div>
