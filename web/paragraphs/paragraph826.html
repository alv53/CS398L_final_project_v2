the love-master disappeared. </span><span style="color:brown">There had been warning, but White Fang was
unversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">He
remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the master's
disappearance; but at the time he suspected nothing. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">That night he
waited for the master to return. </span><span style="color:#00CD66">At midnight the chill wind that blew
drove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin. </span><span style="color:brown">There he drowsed, only
half asleep, his ears keyed for the first sound of the familiar step. </span><span style="color:brown">But, at two in the morning, his anxiety drove him out to the cold front
stoop, where he crouched, and waited. </span></p></div>
