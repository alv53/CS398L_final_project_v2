leaping in and out, and ever inflicting damage. </span><span style="color:brown">And still the bull-dog,

accomplish his purpose, get the grip that would win the battle. </span><span style="color:brown">In the
meantime, he accepted all the punishment the other could deal him. </span><span style="color:brown">His
tufts of ears had become tassels, his neck and shoulders were slashed in
a score of places, and his very lips were cut and bleeding--all from
these lightning snaps that were beyond his foreseeing and guarding. </span></p></div>
